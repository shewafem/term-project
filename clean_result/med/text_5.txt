Disruption of Circadian Insulin Secretion Is
Associated With Reduced Glucose Uptake in 
First-Degree Relatives of Patients With 
Type 2 Diabetes
Guenther Boden, Xinhua Chen, and Marcia Polansky
The objective of this study was to evaluate whether
first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with type 2 diabetes had abnormal circadian insulin secretion and, if
so, whether this abnormality affected their glucose
metabolism. Six African-American FDRs with normal
glucose tolerance and 12 matched normal control subjects (who had no family history of diabetes) were
exposed to 48 h of hyperglycemic clamping (~12 m m o l / l ) .
Insulin secretion rates (ISRs) were determined by
deconvolution of plasma C-peptide levels using individual C-peptide kinetic parameters. Detrending and
smoothing of data (z-scores) and computation of autocorrelation functions were used to identify ISR cycles.
During the initial hours after start of glucose infusions,
ISRs were ~60% higher in FDRs than in control subjects
(585 vs. 366 nmol/16 h, P < 0.05), while rates of glucose
uptake were the same (5.6 mmol · kg– 1 · h– 1), indicating
that the FDRs were insulin resistant. Control subjects
had well-defined circadian (24 h) cycles of ISR and
plasma insulin that rose in the early morning, peaked in
the afternoon, and declined during the night. In contrast, FDRs had several shorter ISR cycles of smaller
amplitude that lacked true periodicity. This suggested
that the lack of a normal circadian ISR increase had
made it impossible for the FDRs to maintain their compensatory insulin hypersecretion beyond 18 h of hyperglycemia. As a result, ISR decreased to the level found
in control subjects, and glucose uptake fell below the
level of control subjects (61 vs. 117 µmol · kg– 1 · min– 1,
P < 0.05). In summary, we found that FDRs with normal
glucose tolerance had defects in insulin action and
secretion. The newly recognized insulin secretory
defect consisted of disruption of the normal circadian
ISR cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion
(and glucose uptake) during the ascending part of the
24 h ISR cycle. D i a b e t e s 4 8 :2 1 8 2–2188, 1999

irst-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with type
2 diabetes develop diabetes at a greater rate than
the normal population (1–3) and have been used to
uncover early abnormalities that may be important
in the development of type 2 diabetes. For instance, several
studies have shown that in glucose-tolerant FDRs, defects in
insulin action precede defects in insulin secretion (1,4–8). Others, however, have shown the opposite: namely, defects in
insulin secretion preceding defects in insulin action (9).
Hence, the question remains unsettled as to whether insulin
resistance or insulin deﬁciency is the primary pathogenetic
event in type 2 diabetes.
We have recently demonstrated that normal subjects have
circadian (24 h) cycles of insulin secretion and plasma insulin
levels (rising in the early morning, peaking in the afternoon,
and declining during the night) (10), which were different
from the earlier recognized short (10–14 min) and longer (1–3
h) pulsatile cycles of insulin secretion (11–13). These circadian
cycles of insulin secretion rate (ISR) and plasma insulin levels were absent in patients with type 2 diabetes (14). It is currently not known whether the absence of circadian ISR cycles
in type 2 diabetes is a secondary phenomenon, i.e., a consequence of the multiple metabolic and hormonal abnormalities
of type 2 diabetes, or whether it is a primary, and perhaps
p a t h o p h y s i o l o g i c a l l y, important phenomenon.
The goal of this study was, therefore, to determine
whether FDRs have abnormal circadian insulin secretion
and, if so, whether this could affect their glucose metabolism.
To this end, we have measured ISR and glucose uptake rates
during 48 h of hyperglycemic clamping in FDRs with normal
glucose tolerance and in matched normal control subjects.
Hyperglycemia was used because it facilitates recognition of
circadian ISR periodicity (10).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
S u b j e c t s . We have studied six African-American FDRs. Of these, four had one and
the other two had two parents with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we have studied
12 African-American control subjects without a family history of diabetes. The control subjects were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 8) was matched for sex,
weight, and age with the FDRs. Group 2 (n = 4) was matched with FDRs for sex,
weight, and age, as well as for ISR (Table 1). All study subjects had normal oral
glucose tolerance tests (Fig. 1); none were taking any medications or participated
in regular exercise programs. Their weights were stable for at least 2 months, and
their diets contained a minimum of 250 g of carbohydrate for at least 2 days before
the studies. The purpose, nature, and potential risks of the study were explained

to all subjects, and informed consent was obtained. The protocol was reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Temple University Hospital.
Experimental design. All subjects were admitted to Temple University Hospit a l ’s General Clinical Research Center on the morning of the studies and received
a standard breakfast at ~9:00 A M. To test the effects of hyperglycemia on insulin
secretion and action, hyperglycemic clamps (~12 mmol/l) were started between
1:00 and 2:00 P M and continued for 48 h. A short polyethylene catheter was
inserted into an antecubital vein for infusion of test substances. Another catheter
was placed into a contralateral forearm vein for blood sampling. This arm was
wrapped with a heating blanket (~70°C) to arterialize venous blood.
Hyperglycemic clamps. A 20% glucose solution was infused at variable rates
calculated to maintain plasma glucose at ~12 mmol/l. Plasma glucose was monitored, and infusion rates were adjusted every hour, or more frequently when
needed. The patients fasted but were allowed to drink water. Plasma electrolytes
were monitored every 6 h, body weight every 12 h, and ﬂuid balance every 6 h.
Fluid balance was maintained with infusion of normal saline. Potassium and magnesium were added to the glucose infusions as needed to maintain normal
plasma concentrations. Blood samples were collected every 30 min for the initial 2 h of glucose infusion and every 2 h thereafter for measurement of glucose,
insulin, and C-peptide.
C-peptide kinetic studies. C-peptide kinetics, needed to calculate insulin secretory rates, were determined several days before the studies. An intravenous
bolus of 50 nmol of biosynthetic human C-peptide (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) was
administered to each subject after an overnight fast, and plasma C-peptide was
measured at frequent intervals for 3 h as described by Polonsky et al. (13) and Va n
Cauter et al. (15). Individual kinetic parameters of C-peptide clearance were
determined by analysis of the C-peptide decay curves.
I S R s . The C-peptide kinetic parameters were used to calculate insulin secretory
rates during the hyperglycemic period by deconvolution of peripheral C-peptide
concentrations according to Polonsky et al. (16). Plasma volume was assumed
to be 4.1% of ideal body weight plus 1% of excess body weight (17).
Determination of diurnal ISR cycles. ISR data were converted to detrended
z-scores using robust biweight regression (18).
Detrended z-scores were calculated as (ISR – ISRp r e d i c t e d) / S Dregression, w h e r e
I S Rp r e d i c t e d equals ISR from the ISR versus time regression and SDr e g r e s s i o n e q u a l s
the standard deviation of the regression line. The autocorrelation function (A) was
determined separately for each subject as A(T) = e C(t) · C(t + T)dt, where C i s
normalized data points, t is the time, and T the lag time of the correlation (19), and
was used to determine ISR periodicity. Measurements were smoothed using
splines (20). Regression analysis with ISR as the dependent variable, the cosine
of time (with periodicity set to 24 h) as the independent variable (21), and ﬁr s t order autocorrelated errors was performed for each subject.
Glucose turnover. Glucose turnover was determined by isotope dilution analysis before (0 h) and after 24 h of hyperglycemia. After a bolus of 30 µmol/kg,
[ 6 , 6-2H2]glucose was infused intravenously for 2 h at a rate of 0.3 µmol · kg– 1 · min– 1.
Glucose was isolated from blood drawn at –90, 0, and 30 min for determination of
isotope enrichment by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Model 4610-B;
Finnigan Mat, San Jose, CA) (22). Rates of glucose appearance and disappearance
were calculated from the isotope enrichment with Steele’s equation for
non–steady state conditions (23). Underestimation of glucose appearance rates during hyperglycemia was avoided by adding [6,6-2H2]glucose to the unlabeled glucose
infused to maintain hyperglycemia (24). In addition, the rate of glucose infused to
maintain the glucose clamp (GIR) was used as an estimation of glucose uptake.
Analytical procedures. Plasma glucose was measured with a glucose analyzer
with the glucose oxidase method; serum free insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay after polyethylene glycol precipitation using an antiserum with minimal (<0.2%) cross-reactivity with proinsulin and with des-31,32-proinsulin (Linco
Research, St. Charles, MO); C-peptide was determined by radioimmunoassay
with an antiserum that cross-reacted <4% with proinsulin (Linco); and proinsulin was determined with an antiserum that cross-reacted 95% with des-31,32human proinsulin and <0.1% with des-64,65-human proinsulin, C-peptide, and
insulin (Linco). Electrolytes were measured at Temple University Hospital’s
Chemistry Laboratory.
Statistical analysis. All data were expressed as means ± SE. Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using analysis of variance and Student’s two-tailed t test when
indicated. The variations in ISR and insulin concentration with time were analyzed
by repeated measures analysis of variance with the SAS program (SAS Institute,
C a r y, NC). The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the median autocorrelations
of FDR and control subjects and to test for the signiﬁcance of the median of the
coefficients of the cosine function of time.
R E S U LT S
Basal glucose and insulin levels. Basal plasma glucose
concentrations were 4.8 ± 0.2 mmol/l in control subjects and
4.8 ± 0.2 mmol/l in FDRs (NS). Basal serum insulin concentrations were 36 ± 6 pmol/l in control subjects and 60 ±
6 pmol/l in FDRs (P < 0.05). Basal C-peptide concentrations
were 0.40 ± 0.06 nmol/l in control subjects and 0.62 ± 0.10
nmol/l in FDRs (P < 0.05). The basal hyperinsulinemia in
FDRs suggested basal insulin resistance.
Insulin secretion during hyperglycemia. Glucose concentrations during the 48-h glucose infusion were the same
in FDR and control subjects (11.8 ± 0.2 and 12.0 ± 0.3 mmol/l,
r e s p e c t i v e l y, NS) (Fig. 2A). During the initial 2 h of hyperglycemia (from 2:00 to 4:00 P M), ISR rose from 67 ± 9 to 442
± 54 pmol/min (P < 0.01) in control subjects and from 94 ± 19
to 736 ± 143 pmol/min (P < 0.01) in FDRs. During the initial
16–18 h of hyperglycemia, areas under the ISR curves (AUC
ISR) were ~60% larger in FDR than in control subjects (585
± 98 vs. 366 ± 60 nmol/16 h, P < 0.05).
Between 18 and 24 h, ISR remained essentially unchanged
in FDRs but rose in control subjects as part of their normal
2 4-h cycle so that at 24 h, ISRs were the same in control subjects and FDRs (Fig. 2B). Between 24 and 48 h, ISRs slowly
declined in FDRs, while in control subjects, ISRs ﬁr s t
declined and then started to rise again.

ABNORMALINSULIN SECRETION IN FIRST-DEGREE RELATIVES
Peripheral insulin concentrations followed closely the
course of ISRs, rising in response to intravenous glucose and
attaining higher concentrations in FDR than in control subjects during the initial 16–18 h (AUC insulin 22.7 ± 2.4 vs. 14.4
± 2.5 nmol · l– 1 · 16 h– 1, P < 0.05), then reaching equal concentrations between 18 and 24 h and declining together
between 24 and 48 h (Fig. 2C) .
The inability of FDRs to raise their ISR after 18 h of hyperglycemia could have been a consequence of unsustainably
high ISR. We, therefore, tested four control subjects (Table 1,
group 2) whose mean initial ISRs (from 2 to 18 h) were as high
as those of the FDRs (511 ± 35 vs. 479 ± 26 pmol/min). In contrast to the FDRs, ISR in these control subjects had a normal
circadian increase, starting at ~18 h, demonstrating that ISR
in the 600–800 pmol/min range did not disrupt their circadian
insulin secretion (Fig. 3).
Glucose uptake. GIR, reﬂecting insulin plus glucose-stimulated glucose uptake, were the same during the initial 18 h of
hyperglycemia in control subjects and FDRs (AUC GIR 5.6 ±
0.3 vs. 5.6 ± 0.6 mmol · kg– 1 · h– 1). When the ISR became
equal in FDR and control subjects between 18 and 24 h, GIR
in FDRs started to decline relative to control subjects and
remained lower in FDR than control subjects between 24
and 48 h (AUC GIR 4.13 ± 0.45 vs. 3.16 ± 0.5 mmol · kg– 1 · h– 1,
P < 0.05) (Fig. 2D) .
Rates of isotopically determined glucose disappearance
(GR d) (the calculation of which, unlike GIR, is not affected
by residual endogenous glucose production) were similar
( 7 2 ± 9 vs. 80 ± 4 µmol · kg– 1 · min– 1, NS) in control subjects
and FDRs, respectively, after ~1 h of hyperglycemia. After
2 4 h of hyperglycemia, however, GR d was higher in control
subjects than in FDRs (117 ± 6 vs. 61 ± 6 µmol · kg– 1 · min– 1,
P < 0.05), conﬁrming the presence of uncompensated insulin
resistance in FDRs.
Circadian rhythmicity of ISR. The temporal pattern of
ISR was markedly different in FDR and control subjects. In
control subjects, ISR started to rise in the early morning
hours, peaked in the early afternoon, and then declined to
reach a nadir between 2:00 and 6:00 A M the next day (Figs. 2
and 4). The ISR pattern in FDRs was irregular, the detrended
data showing several peaks of smaller amplitude and shorter
duration that more or less disappeared upon smoothing (Fig.
4, upper a n d middle panels). This abnormal pattern of ISR
was seen in all six FDRs (Fig. 5).
The ﬁrst-order autocorrelation function in control subjects was positive for lags of 1–4 h, then became negative for
lags of 4–16 h, and after that reverted to become positive
again, suggesting a periodicity of ~24 h. The cosine function
of time in the regression model was highly signiﬁcant (P <
0.001), conﬁrming periodicity of ISR (Fig. 4, lower panel). In
contrast, there was no clear periodicity in FDRs. Mean ﬁr s t FIG. 2. Plasma glucose and insulin levels and ISRs and GIRs during 48 h

order autocorrelation in FDRs was close to 0, indicating that
there were short-term ﬂuctuations in ISR over 2-h periods (P =
0.01 for the difference in short-term ISR ﬂuctuations between
relatives and control subjects). The 24-h autocorrelation was
also close to 0, and the autocorrelation function did not have
a wave-like appearance, which indicated that there was no
true 24-h periodicity. Similar results were obtained with
plasma insulin levels (data not shown).
Plasma cortisol and melatonin. Cortisol and melatonin
concentrations were determined during one full 24-h cycle to
test whether these hormones had maintained their normal circadian rhythmicity. Cortisol and melatonin levels both rose,
peaked, and declined similarly in normal control subjects
and FDRs (Fig. 6).
P r o i n s u l i n . To assess whether hyperglycemic stress could
have caused a dysfunction in the processing of proinsulin to
insulin, plasma proinsulin and proinsulin-to-insulin ratios
were measured serially. Basal proinsulin concentrations
were 6.0 ± 2.1 pmol/l in control subjects and 12.0 ± 1.5 pmol/l
in FDRs (P < 0.05). Basal molar proinsulin-to-insulin ratios
were 0.15 ± 0.04 in control subjects and 0.21 ± 0.03 in FDRs
(NS). During hyperglycemia, proinsulin rose in both groups,
stabilizing at ~50–60 pmol/l in control subjects and at
~110–120 pmol/l in FDRs. The proinsulin-to-insulin ratios
decreased initially during glucose infusion (P < 0.05) (from
0.15 ± 0.04 to 0.04 ± 02 in control subjects and from 0.21 ± 0.03
to 0.06 ± 0.007 in FDRs, P < 0.05) and subsequently rose in
both groups, approaching basal rates at the end of the studies (0.13 ± 0.08 and 0.16 ± 0.03 at 44 h). At no time were
proinsulin-to-insulin ratios in control subjects and FDRs
s i g n i ﬁcantly different from each other (Fig. 7).

Disrupted circadian insulin secretion in FDRs. The normal control subjects in this study exhibited well-deﬁned 24h (circadian) cycles of ISR and insulin levels, rising in the early
morning hours, peaking in the early afternoon, and declining
during the night, conﬁrming previous ﬁndings (10). In contrast,
all six FDRs had no circadian cycles of ISR (or of insulin), but
instead had several irregular and shorter ISR cycles that
lacked true periodicity (Figs. 4 and 5). Similar results were
obtained when plasma insulin levels were analyzed (data not
shown). The cause for the abnormal patterns of ISR and
insulin in FDRs is not known. Numerous publications, howe v e r, have demonstrated a strong relationship between the
light/dark cycle, plasma melatonin levels, a robust marker of
circadian light/dark periodicity (25,26), and circadian biorhythms, including those associated with blood pressure,
core body temperature, and plasma cortisol levels (27,28).

ABNORMALINSULIN SECRETION IN FIRST-DEGREE RELATIVES
synaptically connect the retina with suprachiasmatic nuclei
in the hypothalamus, are the principal pacemakers of circadian periodicity and that their linkage with the retina mediates the synchronization with the light/dark cycle (28). We
have, therefore, measured plasma cortisol and melatonin levels in an attempt to determine whether the abnormal ISR
rhythmicity was caused by a central nervous system or a
b-cell defect. The ﬁnding of normal circadian patterns of
plasma cortisol and melatonin levels in FDRs (Fig. 6) suggested that the defect may have been located in their b- c e l l s .
It is interesting that irregularities of pulsatile insulin secretion have been observed previously in FDRs (29). However,
since the FDRs in that study were already glucose intolerant,
it was not clear whether these pulsatile secretory abnormalities were of primary or secondary nature. Seen in light of the
present ﬁndings, however, they suggest that there may be a
fundamental disturbance of all types of cyclic insulin secretion in FDRs.
The disrupted circadian ISR pattern reduced insulin secretion and glucose uptake. Initially, b-cells of FDRs seemed to
function appropriately in response to the acute rise in plasma
glucose, secreting a greater than normal amount of insulin to
compensate for the underlying insulin resistance. This
changed after ~16–18 h, when ISRs rose in control subjects as
part of their normal 24 h cycles, while ISRs in FDRs either did
not change or declined. By ~24 h, ISR (and plasma insulin) were
the same in FDR and control subjects and glucose uptake in
FDRs had begun to fall below that of control subjects (Fig. 2).
Thus, the absence of a cyclic ISR rise in FDRs at that time
appeared to have been responsible for the loss of compensatory
insulin oversecretion and the decrease in glucose uptake.
It could be argued that the inability of FDRs to raise their
ISR after 18 h was due to the fact that their ISRs were already
very high and could not be raised further. In other words, the
same would have occurred in normal control subjects, had
their initial ISRs been equally as high as those of the FDRs.

This possibility seems rather unlikely, since we have demonstrated that a group of normal control subjects who had ISRs
as high as the initial ISRs of FDRs were able to maintain
their normal circadian ISR cycles for >24 h (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be excluded that the FDRs
had a reduced b-cell mass (30) and that because of that,
secreting the same amount of insulin as control subjects presented increased secretory stress.
The reason that FDRs were able to maintain higher ISR than
control subjects during the initial 16–18 h is not clear. It could
have been due to the fact that in control subjects, ISR
declined during most of this period as part of their normal 24-h
ISR cycle. Alternatively, it is possible that 18 h of hyperglycemia had somehow exhausted the b-cells in FDRs (31).
To explore possible reasons for the b-cell dysfunction in
FDRs, we considered the possibility that the prolonged
hyperglycemia had placed an increased demand on proinsulin
processing, which may have become dysfunctional (32). This
seemed reasonable because of reports that patients with
type 2 diabetes have disproportionally elevated plasma levels of proinsulin and its conversion intermediates, suggesting
that the processing of proinsulin to insulin was perturbed
(33–35). If this was the case in FDRs, one would expect to see
accumulation of proinsulin and its most abundant intermediate metabolite, des-31,32-proinsulin (33,36). This, however,
was not the case. Plasma proinsulin (which included des31,32-proinsulin) was only ~6% of plasma insulin during the
ﬁrst 6 h of hyperglycemia and the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio
was similar in FDR and control subjects at all times (Fig. 7).
The slow increase in the proinsulin-to-insulin ratios, which
occurred throughout hyperglycemia in both groups, was
probably caused by the longer half-life of proinsulin compared
with insulin (37), which resulted in accumulation of proinsulin
(and des-31,32-proinsulin) in the blood. Hence, our studies did
not support the notion that prolonged hyperglycemia in
FDRs had interfered with processing of proinsulin to insulin.
L a s t l y, it is necessary to consider what role glucose toxicity/desensitization (38) may have played in the abnormal
b-cell function in FDRs. We have previously shown in normal
control subjects that the same degree of hyperglycemia as
that used here (i.e., ~12 mmol/l) inhibited glucose uptake as
well as insulin secretion, i.e., produced glucose toxicity after
~35–40 h (39). Therefore, interpretation of ISR and GIR data
after ~35 h of hyperglycemia in this study is complicated by
the development of glucose toxicity/desensitization. On the
other hand, it is conceivable that b-cells of FDRs were more
susceptible than those of control subjects to glucose toxicity/desensitization and that, therefore, glucose desensitization may have been responsible for some of the b-cell dysfunction in FDRs.
Clinical relevance. Here, we have demonstrated an insulin
secretory defect in insulin-resistant FDRs. The defect consisted of a disruption of the normal circadian insulin secretion cycle that resulted in subnormal insulin secretion (and
glucose uptake) because of absence of the ascending part of
the 24-h ISR cycle. The insulin secretory defect was demonstrated under conditions of prolonged hyperglycemia.
Whether it also affects insulin secretion under everyday living conditions and whether our ﬁndings apply to a larger
population of FDRs remains to be shown. The fact that the
FDRs all had normal oral glucose tolerance tests does not rule
out that the defect in circadian insulin secretion may play an
important role in the development of glucose intolerance in
FDRs. First, the glucose tolerance tests were done near the
nadir (8:00–9:00 A M) of the ISR cycle, i.e., at a time when one
would not expect to ﬁnd differences between FDR and control subjects. In addition, there is some evidence that the
secretory defect is progressing from a disrupted (this study)
to a completely absent (14) circadian ISR cycle.
