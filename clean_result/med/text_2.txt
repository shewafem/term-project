MyoD, a master regulator of myogenesis, exhibits a circadian
rhythm in its mRNA and protein levels, suggesting a possible role
in the daily maintenance of muscle phenotype and function. We
report that MyoD is a direct target of the circadian transcriptional
activators CLOCK and BMAL1, which bind in a rhythmic manner to
the core enhancer of the MyoD promoter. Skeletal muscle of
ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mutant mice exhibited ∼30% reductions in
normalized maximal force. A similar reduction in force was observed at the single-ﬁber level. Electron microscopy (EM) showed
that the myoﬁlament architecture was disrupted in skeletal muscle
of ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−mice. The alteration in myoﬁlament organization was associated with decreased expression of
actin, myosins, titin, and several MyoD target genes. EM analysis
also demonstrated that muscle from both ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−
mice had a 40% reduction in mitochondrial volume. The remaining
mitochondria in these mutant mice displayed aberrant morphology
and increased uncoupling of respiration. This mitochondrial pathology was not seen in muscle of MyoD−/−mice. We suggest that
altered expression of both Pgc-1α and Pgc-1β in ClockΔ19 and
Bmal1−/−mice may underlie this pathology. Taken together, our
results demonstrate that disruption of CLOCK or BMAL1 leads to
structural and functional alterations at the cellular level in skeletal
muscle. The identiﬁcation of MyoD as a clock-controlled gene provides a mechanism by which the circadian clock may generate
a muscle-speciﬁc circadian transcriptome in an adaptive role for
the daily maintenance of adult skeletal muscle.

A
fundamental, evolutionarily conserved property of most
organisms, from cyanobacteria to plants and animals, is the
daily cycling of their internal physiology as well as certain behaviors in animals, such as sleep and feeding (1). The timing of
these circadian rhythms is synchronized to the environment by
external cues, with light and nutrient availability being two of the
most salient entrainment cues (2). The synchronization of endogenous circadian rhythms with the daily cycles in the environment provides an adaptive mechanism for organisms to anticipate
cyclic demands on cellular physiology and behavior (3, 4). At the
molecular level, the circadian clock represents a well-deﬁned gene
regulatory network composed of transcriptional-translational
feedback loops (5). The positive arm of the loop is composed of
the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize and bind to E-box elements on target genes such as Per1
to drive the negative part of the feedback loop (5). More recently,
the same molecular clock factors that have been identiﬁed in the
central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus have been found to
exist in most peripheral tissues (reviewed in ref. 6).
We recently characterized the circadian transcriptome of adult
skeletal muscle. These mRNAs exhibit signiﬁcant oscillation in
gene expression with a repeating period length of 24 h. One of
the intriguing observations from the array data was the ﬁnding that
MyoD mRNA exhibited a circadian pattern (7, 8). MyoD is a wellestablished skeletal muscle-speciﬁc transcription factor that directly
regulates expression of the myogenic program (9). In addition to
MyoD, we found that the core components of the molecular clock,
including Bmal1 and Per2 expression, were oscillating as is seen
in liver and other peripheral tissues (7). Interestingly, MyoD expression, like Per2 mRNA, did not oscillate in muscle of the
ClockΔ19 mutant mouse, suggesting the possibility that MyoD is
a clock-controlled gene.
We show here that MyoD is regulated by the circadian transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1. In addition, we ﬁnd
that skeletal muscles from either ClockΔ19 or Bmal1−/−mice exhibit signiﬁcant functional deﬁcits in contractile force, disrupted
myoﬁlament architecture, and altered expression of MyoD target
genes. Morphological and functional analyses show that the
muscle of MyoD−/−mice phenocopy that seen in the ClockΔ19 and
Bmal1−/−mice, providing evidence that suggests that MyoD may
act as a molecular link between the circadian clock and skeletal
muscle maintenance. The skeletal muscles of ClockΔ19 and
Bmal1−/−, but not MyoD−/−, mice also have profound mitochondrial pathologies that were associated with altered expression of
both Pgc-1α and Pgc-1β in the circadian mutant mice. These
results show that a lineage-speciﬁc transcription factor, MyoD, is
a clock-controlled gene and deﬁne the circadian factors CLOCK
and BMAL1 as critical modulators of molecular, cellular, and
functional parameters of skeletal muscle.
Results
MyoD Is a Clock-Controlled Gene. We recently reported that myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) mRNA is expressed in a circadian
fashion in adult skeletal muscle (7). The identiﬁcation of MyoD as
a circadian gene was of interest because MyoD is well-established
as a master regulator of the skeletal muscle transcriptional program (9). To validate the array results, we performed quantitative

PCR analysis of MyoD mRNA from wild-type gastrocnemius
muscles collected every 4 h for 48 h. The frequency (every 4 h)
and duration (48 h) of sample collection was required to establish
the 24-hr repeating oscillation pattern of circadian mRNA expression. The results are presented in Fig. 1A and conﬁrm that
MyoD mRNA exhibits a circadian oscillation with a greater than
twofold change in amplitude over 24 h (Fig. 1A). Analysis of
MyoD mRNA levels in muscle from ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice
(Fig. 1 A and B) demonstrated that the circadian oscillation in
MyoD mRNA was abolished, similar to other known cycling genes
such as Per2 and Dbp. Western blot analysis of whole-muscle
extracts from wild-type mice show that MYOD protein levels
oscillate over 24 h with the peak levels in MYOD protein lagging
the peak mRNA levels by about 4–8 h (Fig. 1C).
To test whether MyoD was a transcriptional target of CLOCK
and BMAL1, we performed transcriptional reporter gene and
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. MyoD luciferase reporter genes (CE+6.8MyoD, 6.8MyoD; Fig. 1D), which
incorporated previously identiﬁed regulatory regions of the MyoD
promoter; the 6.8 kb of the 5′ ﬂanking region that contained the
distal regulatory region (DRR) plus or minus the core enhancer
(CE) were used (10, 11). As shown in Fig. 1D, expression of
CLOCK and BMAL1 signiﬁcantly induced expression of the Per1
reporter ∼2.5-fold and the CE+6.8MyoD reporter approximately
sixfold (P < 0.05). However, activation of the MyoD reporter required the CE element, as expression of BMAL1 and CLOCK did
not activate the 6.8MyoD reporter. Full activation of the CE
+6.8MyoD reporter required a wild-type CLOCK activator because transfection with an expression vector encoding the ClockΔ19
mutant cDNA resulted in an about 50% reduction in MyoD promoter activity (Fig. 1D). The CE and the DRR enhancers of the
MyoD promoter have previously been shown using enhancerspeciﬁc knockout mice to provide complementary regulation of
MyoD expression during development and maturation (12, 13).
ChIP assays were performed using muscle samples collected from
mice at selected times when MyoD mRNA is lowest [circadian time
26 (CT26)] and when MyoD mRNA is rising (CT38) to determine
whether CLOCK and BMAL1 bind the CE or DRR of the MyoD
promoter in adult skeletal muscle. We found that CLOCK and
BMAL1 bind to the CE and that this binding was enriched by 12and 34-fold, respectively, at CT38 compared with CT26. In contrast, no CLOCK or BMAL1 binding was detected at the DRR,
regardless of the time of day (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these
results support the hypothesis that MyoD is a direct target of
CLOCK:BMAL1 binding at the CE and thus is a primary clockcontrolled gene.
Decreased Function and Altered Structure in Skeletal Muscle of
Circadian Mutant and MyoD−/−Mice. We next tested whether speciﬁc tension, a measure of muscle function, was compromised in
ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−mice compared with that of
wild-type mice. Speciﬁc tension is the maximal isometric tetanic
force normalized for muscle size; an example of a force trace from
wild-type muscle is shown in Fig. 2A. The average speciﬁc tension
(Fig. 2B) was signiﬁcantly depressed in the extensor digitorum
longus (EDL) muscles of 12- to 14-wk-old ClockΔ19 (−29.7%),
Bmal1−/−(−34.4%), and MyoD−/−(−33%) mice compared with
EDL muscles from wild-type mice (P < 0.05). This decrease in
speciﬁc tension was due to lower maximal force as we found that
there was no difference in EDL wet mass or ﬁber length among
the genotypes. In addition, light microscopy of toludine-blue–
stained muscle sections indicated that there were no dramatic
pathologies. As seen in Fig. S1, the ﬁbers from the ClockΔ19
mutant and MyoD−/−mice did not exhibit any disease hallmarks
such as central nuclei or signiﬁcant areas of fat or connective
tissue inﬁltration.
To test whether the mechanical deﬁcits could be detected at the
single-cell level, we performed mechanics on isolated skinned ﬁber segments from EDL muscles of wild-type and Bmal1−/−mice
(14). Similar to that seen with whole-muscle tissue, maximally
activated speciﬁc tension (in kNm−2: force normalized for Per1
cross-section) was signiﬁcantly lower in the ﬁber segments from
the Bmal1−/−mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2C). To
evaluate potential inﬂuences of calcium sensitivity, the tension
measures at each of the calcium concentrations were normalized
to the maximal tension for each ﬁber (Fig. 2D). We found no
difference in the relative force:pCa (pCa = −log10 [Ca2+]) curves,
indicating that the difference in maximal speciﬁc tension was not
due to altered calcium ion sensitivity of the myoﬁlaments from
Bmal1−/−mice.
The results of single-ﬁber experiments suggest that the decrement
in force capacity of muscle could occur at the level of myoﬁlament
organization. We used electron microscopy (EM) to evaluate the
myoﬁlament and sarcomeric architecture of skeletal muscle from
wild-type, ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−mice (n = 3/genotype).

MyoD is a clock-controlled gene in skeletal muscle. (A) Expression of
MyoD in wild type (●) and ClockΔ19 (○) muscle was determined by quantitative PCR. Samples were collected every 4 h for 48 h starting at circadian
time 18 (CT18) through CT62. Even though all collections were performed
under total darkness, the dark and light stripes on the graph represent
presumptive dark and light phases of the mice. (B) The diurnal expression
(12:00 AM vs. 12:00 PM) of MyoD in wild-type (lanes 1–4) and Bmal1−/−(lanes
5–8) skeletal muscle was determined by semiquantitative PCR normalized to
Rpl26 gene expression. Muscles (n = 4/group) were collected under DD at
either 12:00 AM (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or 12:00 PM (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8).

signiﬁcantly transactivated Per1 and CE-MyoD reporter genes by ∼2.5-fold
and 6-fold, respectively, relative to control transfections (open bar). MyoD

vealed that the highly conserved hexagonal arrangement of the thin
and thick ﬁlaments was signiﬁcantly disrupted in muscle from the
ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−mice (Fig. 2E). The abnormal
geometry observed in the myoﬁlament structure of ClockΔ19,
Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−mice was deﬁned by variation in the number
of thin ﬁlaments associated with each thick ﬁlament, irregular thinto-thin ﬁlament spacing, and irregular thick-to-thick ﬁlament spacing. We also found that when we analyzed EM images from longitudinal sections of muscle from ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−
mice that the registry of the sarcomeres was compromised (Fig. S2).
Decreased Mitochondrial Volume and Depressed Respiratory Function
of Muscles from Circadian Mutant Mice. The electron micrographs
from the gastrocnemius muscles of the ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and
MyoD−/−mice were also used to analyze mitochondria. From
these micrographs we found that there was a dramatic loss
in the number of mitochondria, especially beneath the muscle
membrane in muscle of the ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice (Fig. 3A
and Fig. S3). The mitochondrial volume was quantiﬁed using
the point-counting morphometric technique as described by
Eisenberg (15). Consistent with the images, there was a 40%
reduction in mitochondrial volume of skeletal muscle from
ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice (Fig. 3B). In addition to the dramatic loss of mitochondria, higher magniﬁcation revealed that
the remaining mitochondria exhibited a pathological morphology characterized by swelling and disruption of cristae (Fig. 3C).

By contrast, skeletal muscle of MyoD−/−showed no mitochondrial phenotype (Fig. S4).
We next isolated mitochondria from gastrocnemius and diaphragm muscles of wild-type and Bmal1−/−mice and determined
the biochemical function and the respiratory control ratio (RCR).
The RCR represents the ratio of state 3 to state 4 respiration and
indicates how well coupled the biochemical processes are within the
mitochondria. Compared with wild-type mitochondria, the RCR
of mitochondria isolated from gastrocnemius (GTN) and diaphragm (DIA) muscles of Bmal1−/−mice was depressed 43% and
72%, respectively (Fig. 3D). The decrease in the RCR of mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscle of Bmal1−/−was primarily
due to a reductionin state 3 respiration as state 4 respirationwas not
signiﬁcantly different from wild type (Fig. 3E and Fig. S5). These
results are consistent with the EM analysis and indicate that the
function of the surviving mitochondria in the muscles of the 12- to
14-wk-old Bmal1−/−mice are impaired.
Altered Expression of Pgc-1α and Pgc-1β in Circadian Mutant Skeletal
Muscle. Because the mitochondrial pathology was not found in the
muscle of MyoD−/−mice, we looked for potential genes that could
link the circadian factors CLOCK and BMAL1 with mitochondrial biogenesis/function. Data from the expression proﬁling of
the skeletal-muscle circadian transcriptome identiﬁed Pgc-1β as
a circadian mRNA (Fig. 4A). We performed quantitative PCR
measurements of Pgc-1β in wild-type skeletal muscle and found
circadian mRNA expression that was damped in the muscle of
ClockΔ19 mice (Fig. 4B). We also conﬁrmed that Pgc-1α expression, although not circadian, was signiﬁcantly down-regulated in
skeletal muscle of ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice compared with
wild-type mice (Fig. 4C) (7). These results show that both members of the Pgc-1 coactivator family are mis-regulated in muscle of
both ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice.
Discussion
The results presented here demonstrate that the circadian factors
CLOCK and BMAL1 are critical for skeletal-muscle function,
structure, and mitochondrial content. Muscles from both ClockΔ19
and Bmal1−/−mice showed profound decrements in forcegenerating capacity, signiﬁcant myoﬁlament and sarcomeric disarray, and mitochondrial pathologies. Molecular studies identiﬁed
MyoD, the muscle-speciﬁc transcription factor, as a clockcontrolled gene under direct transcriptional control of CLOCK
and BMAL1. Additionally, muscle from adult MyoD−/−mice
exhibits similar functional and structural abnormalities as those
seen in ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice, providing evidence that
suggests that circadian regulation of MyoD may be one mechanism
for maintaining adult skeletal muscle. However, the mitochondrial
pathologies observed in the ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice were not
found in the muscle of the MyoD−/−mouse. We found that both
Pgc-1α and Pgc-1β were mis-expressed in the muscles of ClockΔ19
and Bmal1−/−mice. From these results we suggest a working
model, illustrated in Fig. 4D, in which the transcriptional activators
CLOCK and BMAL1 regulate daily expression of MyoD as
a component of a maintenance program for structure and mechanical function. In addition, we suggest that CLOCK and
BMAL1 may regulate Pgc-1 in a parallel pathway to maintain
mitochondrial levels. These results provide molecular, cellular,
and physiological evidence to support the critical role of CLOCK
and BMAL1 in adult skeletal-muscle function and metabolism.
Circadian Rhythms, Skeletal Muscle, and MyoD. Circadian rhythms
and the core clock factors CLOCK and BMAL1 have been implicated in a growing number of systemic pathologies, including
metabolic disease, aging, and cardiovascular disease (16–18). To
date, however, no genetic studies have examined what role circadian rhythms play in adult skeletal muscle. Our earlier results
from an expression proﬁling study identiﬁed circadian expression
of the components of the molecular clock (e.g., Bmal1, Per2) and
showed that expression of MyoD, a master regulator of skeletal
muscle differentiation, followed a circadian pattern (7, 8).
MyoD is the founding member of the myogenic regulatory
factor family of transcription factors, which includes Myf5,
myogenin, and MRF4 (19). Although the function of MyoD in
myogenesis is known in considerable detail, our understanding of
its role in adult skeletal muscle remains incomplete (20). The
deﬁcit in speciﬁc tension of MyoD−/−mice, in addition to their
impaired regenerative ability, suggests that MyoD serves an important function in adult skeletal muscle (21, 22). The importance of MyoD function in adult skeletal muscle is further
underscored by the observation that MyoD expression is altered
in a number of muscular dystrophies as well as in sarcopenia, the
age-associated loss of muscle mass (23–25). The identiﬁcation of
MyoD as a clock-controlled gene expands the function of MyoD
beyond its well-known role in myogenesis to include a role in the
daily maintenance of adult skeletal muscle.
The loss of circadian expression of MyoD in skeletal muscle
from both ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice is very similar to what has

been previously observed with other genes known to be regulated
by BMAL1 and CLOCK, such as Per2 and Dbp (referred to as
clock-controlled genes) (7, 8). Results from reporter gene assays
and ChIP experiments conﬁrmed that MyoD is a direct target of
CLOCK and BMAL1. In particular, ChIP assays show that
CLOCK and BMAL1 bind to the MyoD CE and not to the DRR
of the promoter. The CE is located ≈20 kb upstream of the
transcriptional start site, and analysis of MyoD expression in the
CE knockout mouse revealed that the CE is required to ensure
the correct temporal activation of MyoD transcription during
development (12, 26). The fact that the CE has been shown to be
critical for proper temporal expression of MyoD during development and now for the circadian expression of MyoD raises
intriguing questions about the possibility that (i) CLOCK and/or
BMAL1 have a noncircadian function during myogenesis and (ii)
the CE serves as a “timing” module to provide a temporal component to MyoD expression during embryonic development and
adulthood. At this time, CLOCK and/or BMAL1 have not been
shown to regulate developmental gene expression in mammals,
but there are some studies linking their homologs to development in Arabidopsis (27).
As a global assessment of muscle-tissue function, we found
that the speciﬁc tension of skeletal muscle was signiﬁcantly depressed in the circadian mutant mice. Surprisingly, skeletal
muscle from both ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice displayed a similar reduction in speciﬁc tension, and these deﬁcits are very
comparable to those observed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy
as well as those seen with aging (28, 29). An important consideration for interpretations of our ﬁndings is that even though the
muscle pathologies reported in the Bmal1−/−and ClockΔ19 mice
are similar, the health and phenotype of the mice are profoundly
different. The ClockΔ19 mouse has a normal life span, but it
exhibits signs of metabolic disease by 8 mo of age (16). The
Bmal1−/−mice die around 12 mo of age but, when they are 10 wk
of age, Bmal1−/−mice have similar body weight, normal skeletalmuscle ﬁber area, and normal distribution of circulating white
blood cells compared with control mice (17). Our experiments
were performed on mice 12–14 wk of age at a time when neither
Bmal1−/−nor ClockΔ19 mice show signiﬁcant disease status (16,
17, 30). Thus, we suggest that the reduction in skeletal-muscle
function is not likely a result of a speciﬁc behavior but instead
due to alterations in molecular clock function. We also found
that the deﬁcits recorded for whole-muscle tissue were present at
the single-cell level. These ﬁndings are consistent with the concept that proper function of the molecular clock in skeletalmuscle ﬁber/cell is critical for maintenance of muscle function.
Molecular Clock and Mitochondria in Skeletal Muscle. We also
detected signiﬁcant mitochondrial pathologies in skeletal muscles
of the ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice. We found a 40% reduction in
mitochondrial volume, and the remaining mitochondria displayed
morphological defects characterized by swelling and disrupted
cristae. These initial observations from EM analyses were
strengthened by our results that mitochondria from both gastrocnemius anddiaphragm muscles ofBmal1−/−micewerefunctionally
impaired as indicated by a reduced RCR. In contrast, we can
conclude that the mitochondrial phenotype was independent of
MyoD because it was not observed in the muscles of MyoD−/−mice.
On the basis of the well-established role of PGC-1 in the
regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle, we
propose that dysregulation of the PGC-1 family is a potential
molecular link to the mitochondrial pathology observed in
skeletal muscle of ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice (31). Recent
studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 contributes to the control
of the molecular clock (32–34), and PGC-1 and SIRT1 have
been shown to interact to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and
fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle (35). The results from this
study found that Pgc-1β expression was no longer circadian in the
muscle of ClockΔ19 mice and that Pgc-1α expression, although
not circadian, was signiﬁcantly decreased in muscle of both
ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice. These results are in agreement with
recent ﬁnding of Liu et al. that Pgc-1α expression cycles in
skeletal muscle (36). Taken together, our results conﬁrm that
Pgc-1 expression is circadian in skeletal muscle and becomes
down-regulated and/or nonrhythmic in muscle of ClockΔ19 and
Bmal1−/−mice. These ﬁndings suggest that interactions between
the PGC-1 coactivators and SIRT1 might link the molecular
clock with daily maintenance of fundamental metabolic/mitochondrial pathways in skeletal muscle.
In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that cell
structure and function of skeletal muscle is impaired in ClockΔ19
and Bmal1−/−mice. Evidence is growing that links inﬂammation,
cancer, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, and metabolic
disease with altered expression of the molecular clock in peripheral tissues (37–39). Thus, the signiﬁcant force and metabolic deﬁcits in the muscle of ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice open
the possibility that the profound peripheral weakness and fatigue
seen in chronic diseases may result from disruption of proper
circadian factor expression in muscle.
Materials and Methods
Animals. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals as approved
by the University of Illinois and University of Kentucky Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committees. In addition to C57BL/6J or BALB/c mice (Jackson
Laboratory), designated as wild type for each genotype, three mutant strains
of mice were used in the current study: homozygous ClockΔ19 (isogenic C57BL/
6J) (40), homozygous MOP3/Bmal1−/−null mutant (congenic on C57BL/6J)
(41), and homozygous MyoD−/−null mutant (isogenic BALB/c) (42). Mice
were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room maintained
on a 12-h light–dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.
Muscle Function. Maximum isometric tetanic force was determined in EDL
muscles from mice [wild type (n = 4), ClockΔ19 (n = 7), Bmal1−/−(n = 3), and
MyoD−/−(n = 4)] following procedures described previously (43).
Single-Fiber Force Measurements. Single chemically permeabilized ﬁbers (n =
20 ﬁbers of wild type; n = 7 ﬁbers of Bmal1−/−) were prepared from EDL
muscles using a technique similar to that described by Campbell and Moss
(44). Experimental records were acquired and analyzed using SLControl
software (14).
Electron Microscopy. Mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Skeletal muscle was ﬁxed by
transcardial perfusion with ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde/4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and 130 mM NaCl. Perfusionﬁxed samples were taken to the microscopy center for further processing.
Thin sections were cut and stained, and images were obtained for quantiﬁcation of mitochondrial volume, assessment of mitochondrial ultrastructure, and myoﬁlament organization.
Mitochondrial Volume. The volume of the muscle ﬁber occupied by mitochondria in skeletal muscle from wild-type, ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−
mice (n = 5/genotype) was determined using the electron microscopy pointcounting method as described by Eisenberg and Salmons (45). To prevent analytical bias, all images were coded and put in random order before counting.
Mitochondrial Respiration. Mitochondrial isolation and respiration from
skeletal muscle was performed as described by Singh et al. (46). For each
experiment, fresh mitochondria were isolated and used within 3 h.
Gene Expression Analysis. Wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice were entrained to a light:
dark (LD) 12:12 cycle for 2 wk, placed in light-tight boxes on a LD 12:12 cycle
for 4 wk, and then released into constant darkness (DD). Starting 30 h after
entry into DD (CT18), skeletal muscles from ﬁve mice were collected every 4 h
for 48 h. At time points CT34 through CT58 in DD, muscles from age-matched
ClockΔ19 mice that had been treated with the same light protocol as the
wild-type mice were collected. The muscles were removed from each hind
leg and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Real-time quantitative PCR using TaqMan
(Applied Biosystems) assays was used to validate the gene expression data
generated from microarray analysis as previously reported for MyoD, Pgc-1α,
and Pgc-1β (7).
Western Blots. Skeletal muscle was homogenized in lysis buffer, and samples
were electrophoresed on 10% SDS/PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane
(Millipore) as described previously (43). Membranes were incubated with

Andrews et al.
a polyclonal antibody against MyoD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or γ-tubulin
(Sigma-Aldrich) followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-linked
anti-rabbit antibody or anti-mouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The membrane
was exposed to ECF substrate (Amersham Bioscience), and signals were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Storm 860; Amersham Bioscience).
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay. Skeletal muscles were collected at the
appropriate circadian time under constant dark conditions as described above
(Gene Expression Analysis). Muscle tissues were homogenized in 1% formaldehyde buffer, and nuclei were isolated on the basis of protocols adapted
from a method described by Ripperger and Schibler (47). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with BMAL1 or CLOCK antibody (Abcam) or
nonspeciﬁc IgG or no antibody as controls. After clearing, samples were
treated with Proteinase K (10 mg/mL) and DNA recovered for PCR. Primers
were designed to amplify an ∼100-bp region within either the MyoD CE or
DRR using AccuPrime Pfx Taq polymerase (Invitrogen).
Construction of the 6.8MyoD and CE-6.8MyoD Reporter Vectors. We used the
MD6.8-lacZ clone (gift from S. Tapscott, The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) as a template to clone 6.8 kb of upstream 5′
ﬂanking sequence into the pGL3basic vector (Promega). Mouse genomic
DNA was then used as a template to clone the CE, which was subsequently inserted upstream of the 6.8-kb ﬂanking sequence to produce
the CE-6.8MyoD reporter vector. The sequence of the CE-6.8MyoD clone
was veriﬁed by sequencing before being used in transient transfection
experiments. The Per1 reporter vector, as previously described by Wilsbacher et al. (48), was used as a positive control in the transfection
experiments.
Transfection Experiments. C2C12 cells (n = 6–8/condition) were transiently
transfected with expression vectors for Clock, Bmal1, or ClockΔ19 cDNAs with
either the Per1 reporter vector or the 6.8MyoD or CE-6.8MyoD reporter
vector using the Fugene6 reagent (Roche). The pRL vector (Promega) was
used to control for transfection efﬁciency. Cells were collected 24–48 h after
transfection and lysed with the passive lysis buffer, and luciferase activities
were measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay System according to the
manufacturer’s directions (Promega).
