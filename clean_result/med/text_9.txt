Epidemiological studies link short sleep duration and circadian disruption with higher risk of metabolic syndrome
and diabetes. We tested the hypotheses that prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, as
can occur in people performing shift work, impairs glucose regulation and metabolism. Healthy adults spent
>5 weeks under controlled laboratory conditions in which they experienced an initial baseline segment of optimal
sleep, 3 weeks of sleep restriction (5.6 hours of sleep per 24 hours) combined with circadian disruption (recurring
28-hour “days”), followed by 9 days of recovery sleep with circadian re-entrainment. Exposure to prolonged sleep
restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, with measurements taken at the same circadian phase, decreased
the participants’ resting metabolic rate and increased plasma glucose concentrations after a meal, an effect resulting
from inadequate pancreatic insulin secretion. These parameters normalized during the 9 days of recovery sleep and
stable circadian re-entrainment. Thus, in humans, prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption
alters metabolism and could increase the risk of obesity and diabetes.
INTRODUCTION
Short sleep duration and disordered sleep have been linked to numerous adverse metabolic changes (such as dysregulation of multiple hormone axes, reduced insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, and glucose
intolerance) (1–4), increased risk of chronic disease including obesity
and type 2 diabetes (5, 6), and early mortality (7, 8). Less is known
about the adverse consequences of misalignment between endogenous
circadian physiological rhythms and the daily environmental and behavioral rhythms, as occurs chronically in night workers and rotating
shift workers (9–12). Endogenous circadian rhythms are controlled by
the central circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the
hypothalamus, and these rhythms help to synchronize molecular circadian clocks in peripheral cells and tissues. Peripheral clocks optimize
physiological functions to match daily patterns of behavior, such as
feeding, activity, and sleep. Suboptimal alignments between endogenous circadian rhythms and daily behaviors occur in the many millions
of people who perform shift work, and this circadian disruption may
contribute to the known adverse health consequences of shift work,
including fatigue and poor sleep, gastrointestinal complaints, detrimental metabolic changes, and increased risks of developing obesity
and diabetes (13–19). For example, over a 3-year follow-up period, the
risk of progressing from impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose
tolerance to clinically classified diabetes was five times higher among
night shift workers than among those who did not work at night (20).
In humans, acute (a few days) misalignment of the normal circadian phases at which sleep and meals occur causes higher postprandial
blood glucose, despite higher insulin concentrations in the blood. The
magnitude of hyperglycemia was comparable to a prediabetic state in a
third of these individuals (21). In mice, a laboratory study of prolonged
(10 weeks) circadian disruption revealed broad adverse changes in the
brain (dendritic reorganization and loss), behavior (learning and response
to novel environments), and glucose metabolism (increased insulin at
the same blood glucose concentrations, and weight gain) (22). It is not
known whether these adverse effects of sustained circadian disruption
also occur in humans, but if they do, they could explain the epidemiological finding of an increased incidence of diabetes in shift workers.
Both sleep patterns and circadian rhythms change profoundly with
age. Older people experience less sleep, more frequent awakenings, a
reduction of slow wave sleep (23), and blunting of the amplitudes of circadian rhythms such as core body temperature (CBT) (24) and activity
(25). Also, the phase relationships between those rhythms and the
timing of sleep change with age (26). Given the possible adverse metabolic changes caused by short sleep and circadian disruption, it is also
plausible that the sleep and circadian changes with age could contribute to the increased incidence of obesity and diabetes in the elderly (1).
Because of these findings, we have here tested the hypotheses that
prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption impairs glucose regulation and metabolism in humans and that this effect
would be more pronounced in older individuals. We have previously
used a forced desynchrony protocol in humans to assess the separate
effects of sleep and of circadian rhythms upon cognitive performance
(12, 22, 27–29). This protocol was also recently used in mice (22). In
this protocol, behaviors, including the wake-sleep cycle and the feedingfasting schedule, are scheduled to occur on “days” that are much shorter
or much longer than 24 hours (for example, 28 hours), and during
wakefulness, lights are kept dim so that the endogenous circadian pacemaker oscillates at its intrinsic period rather than being reset by daily
exposure to the light-dark cycle (12, 28, 29). We selected an imposed
28-hour duration of environmental and behavioral cycles for the current study because it is well outside the range of entrainment of the
circadian pacemaker, forcing desynchronization between endogenous
circadian rhythms and the scheduled dark-light, fasting-feeding, and

sleep-wake cycles. We combined this model of circadian disruption with
sleep restriction of 5.6 hours per 24 hours for ~3 weeks to test our hypotheses that prolonged sleep restriction combined with prolonged circadian
disruption would impair glucose regulation and metabolism and that
such effects would be more pronounced in older people.
RESULTS
Participant characteristics
Twenty-four participants completed the full protocol (12 young plus
12 older participants). Three participants were excluded from group
analyses (see Materials and Methods), leaving 11 young (mean, 23 ±
2 years; 5 female) and 10 older (60 ± 5 years; 5 female) participants
in the analyses.
Measurement segments
To ensure that participants were not suffering from sleep loss before
starting the study and had stable circadian phase alignment, they were
instructed to spend 10 hours in bed each night, with a self-selected but
constant bedtime and normal exposure to daytime light, for at least
3 consecutive weeks immediately before entry into the laboratory.
Thereafter, each participant lived in an individual laboratory suite
for 39 days in dim light and without time cues. Figure 1 schematically
portrays the protocol and highlights the three intensive assessment intervals during which body weight, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and
metabolic responses to a standardized meal were measured: (i) a baseline “sleep-replete” condition with stable circadian phase alignment
(after at least 27 days of 10 to 16 hours of sleep opportunity per 24 hours,
including at least 21 days at home and 6 days in the laboratory); (ii)
after up to 3 weeks of exposure to sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption induced by imposition of 28-hour fasting-feeding,
and sleep-wake cycles, performed in dim light; and (iii) after 9 days of
circadian re-entrainment and recovery sleep opportunity of 10 hours
per 24 hours. These three intensive assessment intervals were timed to
occur when sleep episodes were at the normal optimal circadian phase
for each participant and standardized meals were at similar circadian
phases (see Materials and Methods).
Effects of sleep restriction and circadian disruption on
postprandial hyperglycemia and RMR
After a standard breakfast eaten at a consistent circadian phase, previous exposure to prolonged (3 weeks) sleep restriction with concurrent
circadian disruption significantly increased both fasting and postprandial peak plasma glucose concentrations relative to the responses
to the same meal at baseline [Figs. 2, A, B, E, and F, and 3, A, C, and E;
overall changes: fasted, +8%, P = 0.0019 (signed-rank test); postprandial peak, +14%, P = 0.0004 (t test); integrated postprandial response over 90 min, +15%, P < 0.0001 (t test)]. There were no
statistical differences between age groups in the effects of prolonged
sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption on fasting or
postprandial glucose concentrations. The relative hyperglycemia after
this breakfast meal was apparently caused by inadequate glucosetriggered pancreatic b cell insulin secretion, because fasting plasma insulin
and postprandial peak and integrated plasma insulin concentrations were
significantly reduced [Figs. 2, C, D, G, and H, and 3, B, D, and F; overall
changes: fasted, −12%, P = 0.0064 (signed-rank test); postprandial peak,
−27%, P < 0.0001 (t test); integrated postprandial response over 90 min,
Fig. 1. Study schedule. Participants completed a 39-day laboratory protocol with a baseline sleep-replete condition with 3 weeks of 10 hours/day
of time in bed at home, then 6 days with ≥10 hours time in bed per day.
Sleep opportunities (dark bars) were then spread across the circadian
cycle on a 28-hour forced desynchrony protocol, with 6.5 hours time in
bed (equivalent to 5.6 hours per 24 hours) and 21.5 hours of monitored
wakefulness for 3 weeks. A subsequent interval of 10 days of circadian
re-entrainment with sleep recovery (10 hours time in bed/24 hours) with
the sleep interval adjusted to the same circadian phase as the baseline
sleep condition by modification of the duration of the wake interval after
the last day of forced desynchrony. B, samples taken for standardized

sleep restriction plus circadian disruption such that the standardized
meal occurred during this exposure at the same circadian phase as baseline within 4 hours (0.7 ± 1.8 hours), resulting in an average exposure
duration of 19.2 ± 2.8 24-hour days (range, 15 to 22 days).

was lower at recovery (this results in a significant interaction between
age and condition for the peak postprandial glucose; P = 0.012; Fig. 3C).
Glucose responses expressed as 2-hour postprandial levels (for comparison to the clinical threshold of 140 mg/dl, which indicates impaired glucose tolerance and prediabetes) revealed that 3 of 21 participants had
prediabetic postprandial glucose concentrations after prolonged exposure to sleep restriction with circadian disruption, whereas no participants had abnormal responses during baseline or recovery/realignment
(see profiles, Fig. 2).
Previous exposure to the combination of 3 weeks of sleep restriction plus circadian disruption significantly reduced RMR relative to
baseline (−8% on average for all participants). RMR returned toward
baseline levels in the recovery phase but did not completely recover
(Fig. 3H). There were no statistical differences between the age groups
in the relative magnitude of the reduction in RMR.

fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin responses to a standardized
meal [baseline, peak, area under the curve (AUC) (trapezoidal method),
and 90-min profiles]. The effects of sleep restriction and circadian disruption on glucose (peak, fasted, AUC) were independent of sex.
Effect of sleep and circadian disruption on rhythms of
glucose, insulin, and cortisol
To determine whether there were changes in blood hormones over the
course of the exposure to sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, we took fasted samples from each participant upon awakening on each experimental “day” during the first and third weeks of the
recurring 28-hour cycles (first and third “beat cycles” of the forced
desynchrony as shown in Fig. 1). When grouped across each week, the
sampling times encompassed the full range of circadian phases. There
were significant endogenous circadian rhythms in glucose, insulin, and
cortisol (Fig. 4) (all P < 0.01), with similar amplitudes and timing between the first and the third week of exposure. For each analyte, peaks
occurred about 60 circadian degrees relative to the nadir of the CBT
rhythm (which was assigned a value of 0°), which corresponds to the
usual morning when under normally entrained conditions. For comparison, fasted (prebreakfast) values were collected in the baseline condition at an average circadian phase of 73 ± 27°, which equates to 4.9 hours
after the CBT minimum. Mean fasted cortisol and mean fasted glucose
were similar from week 1 to week 3 (that is, no progressive changes).
However, fasting insulin levels remained close to baseline during the
first week of exposure, then declined below baseline by the third week
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 4). There were no significant differences in any of these
circadian rhythms by age group or sex (P > 0.05).
Twenty-four–hour profiles of leptin and free ghrelin
Compared to baseline, 24-hour profiles of ghrelin concentrations (Fig. 5,
A to D) were slightly higher during sleep restriction and recovery (both
P < 0.05), whereas the 24-hour profiles of leptin (Fig. 5, E to H) were
slightly lower during sleep restriction (P = 0.05) and recovery (P < 0.05).
In the 24-hour profiles of plasma leptin (Fig. 5, E to H), we observed no
significant difference between the age groups across conditions or interactions between age group and condition. There was, however, a significant interaction between age group and time (P = 0.04), reflecting
the higher leptin levels across the scheduled sleep period in young compared to older participants. For 24-hour profiles of free ghrelin (Fig. 5,
A to D), there were no significant differences between age groups
across conditions, and there were significant interactions between age
group and condition (P = 0.02), and between age group and time
(P < 0.0001), reflecting higher across the scheduled sleep periods free
ghrelin levels in young compared to older participants.

Body weight, diet, activity, and body temperature during
exposure to sleep restriction with circadian disruption
Young participants were significantly heavier than older participants
at baseline (72.3 ± 12.0 kg versus 67.9 ± 11.8 kg; P = 0.04), whereas
there was no significant difference in body mass index (24.2 ± 2.6 kg/m2
versus 23.3 ± 1.9 kg/m2). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans at baseline revealed that the average whole-body fat was not significantly different between age groups [17.2 ± 7.3 kg (24.5 ± 8.5% of body weight)
in young; 20.6 ± 2.8 kg (31.3 ± 5.6% of body
weight) in older participants; P = 0.11].
Average trunk fat was slightly lower in the
young participants [7.9 ± 3.7 kg (23.0 ±
8.7% of trunk mass) versus 10.4 ± 2.0 kg
(31.2 ± 5.2% of trunk mass); P = 0.05] in
the older participants. Both groups lost
mass during the study as assessed by fasted,
post-void weights measured at scheduled
wake time on the day before each of the
three standardized metabolic assessments
(condition: P < 0.0001; age × condition: P =
not significant). On average, they lost 1.2 ±
1.3% body mass by the end of sleep restriction with circadian disruption segment
(P = 0.0003), and had lost 1.7 ± 1.7% by
the end of the recovery condition compared
to baseline (P = 0.0003). In a multiple linear
regression model, changes in body weight
were unrelated to changes in RMR, consumed calories (total kilocalorie increased
by an average of only 6 kcal/24 hours from
baseline to sleep restriction), or actigraphically assessed physical activity (which increased by 58 ± 37% from baseline to
sleep restriction, presumably due to the
increased duration of wakefulness). Thus,
the increase in activity without an increase
in food intake would be the most likely
cause of the small reduction in body weight.
In multiple linear regression models comparing baseline to either sleep restriction
with circadian disruption or recovery, weight
changes were not associated with changes
in 24-hour mean leptin levels (percent
fat-adjusted), body temperature, activity
levels, food consumed, or metabolic rate.
Average CBT actually decreased slightly
(0.09 F° ± 0.37 SD) and was positively

that, on average, 0.1° decrease of core temperature corresponds to 0.2 pounds of decrease in body weight. Effects of combined
circadian and sleep disruption on changes
in glucose AUC and insulin AUC were unrelated to changes in body weight (Pearson
correlation r = 0.28, P = 0.22 and r = 0.35,
P = 0.12, respectively). In multiple regression analyses, changes in postprandial insulin and glucose were unrelated to energetics

DISCUSSION
Our findings reveal a potential mechanism that may account for
results from animal studies and human epidemiological findings, suggesting that sleep restriction and circadian disruption are associated
with impaired metabolism and increased risk of obesity and diabetes.
We found that simultaneous exposure to chronic sleep restriction and
circadian rhythm disruption causes a 32% decrease in insulin secretion
in response to a standardized meal. This substantially impaired response led to inadequate glucose regulation: glucose levels were higher
for a longer time and even rose to prediabetic levels in some participants. The inadequate insulin secretion by the b cell may underlie the
elevated risk of diabetes in people subject to chronic exposure to sleep
deficiency and recurrent circadian disruption.
In addition, our data are consistent with recent epidemiological
results demonstrating that life-style factors, including habitually short
sleep duration, increase the risk of weight gain over the life course (30).
The 8% drop in RMR that we measured in our participants who experienced sleep restriction and circadian disruption translates into an
~12.5-pound increase in weight over a single year (120 kcal/day ×
365 days/3500 kcal/pound of fat mass), assuming no changes in activity
or food intake. This weight gain may in turn elevate diabetes risk.
In 1999, Spiegel et al. described alterations of multiple hormonal
axes and glucose intolerance in humans when sleep was restricted to
4 hours per night for 1 week, leading the authors to hypothesize “…that
chronic sleep loss could increase the severity of age-related pathologies, such as diabetes…” (1). Generally, impaired glucose metabolism
is caused in one of two ways: (i) changes in insulin secretion in which
pancreatic b cells do not secrete enough insulin in response to a glucose stimulus, or (ii) altered insulin sensitivity in which peripheral tissues
fail to respond to an insulin signal by increasing their glucose uptake, the
usual response to a meal. In recent experiments, when sleep is restricted
to 5 hours per night for a week, young adult men show reductions in
insulin sensitivity (measured with both euglycemic hyperinsulinemic
clamps and intravenous glucose tolerance tests), with no change in the
acute insulin response and without a change in RMR (3). These findings
are consistent with those from middle-aged adults restricted to 5.5 hours
of sleep per night for 2 weeks, who exhibited decreases in insulin sensitivity (31). Thus, we are beginning to understand the extent to which
sleep deficiency impairs glucose metabolism, but need more information
about the extent, mechanisms, and dynamics of these changes. The magnitude (hours of sleep per night) and duration of sleep restriction (days
to weeks) are likely to be important in determining the speed and extent
of diabetogenic changes.
Another recent study demonstrated that acute circadian misalignment (sleeping during the biological day and eating during the biological night), as occurs with jet lag and shift work, results in similar
adverse effects on glucose metabolism: increased postprandial glucose
despite increased circulating insulin levels, suggesting reduced insulin
sensitivity, coupled with an inability of the pancreas to sufficiently increase insulin secretion (21). Circadian misalignment usually also involves some degree of sleep restriction (sleep efficiency declined by
17% when misaligned in that study), representing a combined physiological challenge. The protocol in the present study was a more prolonged and severe challenge, combining sleep and concurrent circadian
disruption for an average of 19 days. Sleep restriction alone in younger
men and middle-aged adults leads to no change in RMR (3, 32). However, our prolonged sleep restriction and circadian disruption protocol
caused a notable decrease in RMR, along with significantly elevated glucose in response to a meal.
Quite unexpectedly, and unlike previous results from short-term
acute sleep interventions, we also found a decreased insulin response
to a standardized meal, suggesting that there was pancreatic dysfunction unrelated to the small loss of body weight. Previous sleep restriction
studies have shown reduced insulin sensitivity (3, 31) but no change in
the insulin response to a meal (1). Although a decreased insulin response to a more metabolically challenging glucose tolerance test has
been reported in one sleep restriction study (1), two more recent studies
have not observed this change (3, 31). In contrast, acute circadian misalignment results in a higher postprandial insulin response that is nonetheless inadequate (21). Our findings demonstrate that, with long-term
(chronic) exposure to sleep restriction and circadian disruption, the
pancreas exhibits more severe dysfunction, as shown by our observation
that insulin levels actually decreased despite elevated plasma glucose
levels. This physiological mechanism could explain the association
of habitual sleep deficiency and elevated risk for obesity and diabetes
(5, 6) and for weight gain and diabetes in a longitudinal study of male
night workers (33, 34). In our study, the effects in these healthy individuals were largely reversible with 9 days of stable circadian re-entrainment
and recovery sleep.
All of the metabolic assessments that we made during baseline and
after exposure to chronic sleep restriction and circadian disruption
were done at the same transiently realigned phase of the central circadian pacemaker. Controlling for the central circadian pacemaker phase
of the metabolic assessment ensured that the effects observed were due
to the combination of the previous histories of prolonged sleep restriction and of circadian disruption, rather than acute misalignment. Further research will be necessary to understand the development of
metabolic dysregulation via desynchronization of the central circadian
pacemaker with respect to peripheral tissue oscillators and sleep-wake,
fasting-feeding, and dark-light cycles (35).
Peripheral clocks are entrained by food intake in rodents (36). Although no data are available from human studies, it is possible that the
effects we observed are a result of a reduced temporal coordination
between central circadian pacemaker and peripheral tissues (37) such
as the pancreas that may be responding to changes in meal timing independent of central circadian clocks (38). Misalignment of the phase
of peripheral oscillators (for example, in the pancreas and liver) with
that of the central circadian pacemaker may thus also play a role in metabolic dysregulation. If the central circadian pacemaker and peripheral
pacemakers are out of phase, then the normally coordinated response
to a meal may be dysfunctional and lead to abnormal physiological
responses to food intake. Peripheral metabolism-related oscillators
coordinate both metabolic and circadian pathways (39) required for
normal hepatic lipid metabolism and homeostasis (40). These findings
and others (35), together with our current results, suggest that synchronized central and peripheral circadian processes may also be necessary
for the optimal regulation of energy homeostasis in mammals.
Previous studies of sleep restriction in healthy young men have shown
a decrease in plasma leptin and an increase in total ghrelin coupled
with increased hunger and appetite (41, 42), possibly reflecting relative
underfeeding in those studies. A study of young women exposed to a

single night of partial sleep restriction revealed an elevation of fasted
morning leptin levels (43). Epidemiological studies of short sleep duration have shown that shorter self-reported habitual sleep duration
is associated with lower leptin levels and higher total ghrelin levels
(44, 45). In contrast, another laboratory study in middle-aged men and
women exposed to either 8.5 or 5.5 hours per night of time in bed for
2 weeks but with ad libitum food observed no differences in leptin or
ghrelin. Instead, calorie consumption in the form of snacking increased,
such that the participants consumed more than 200 kcal more food per
day in the sleep-restricted condition (32). This increased food intake
may have thereby normalized the leptin- and ghrelin-related hunger
signal associated with sleep restriction. Although we observed no change
in fasted morning leptin levels in either young or older participants exposed to prolonged sleep restriction, circadian disruption, and controlled
caloric intake at the end of this segment and through recovery, 24-hour
leptin was slightly lower and 24-hour free ghrelin was slightly higher.
This result may indicate that the combination of sleep restriction plus
circadian disruption may be a qualitatively different challenge than either sleep restriction or circadian disruption alone, or that the prolonged duration of our stimulus (averaging 19 days) may have been
responsible for the leptin and free ghrelin results.
Glucose and cortisol concentrations were higher during the first week of
the combineddisruptions (relative to baseline), andthese levelspersisted
atallcircadianphasesthroughthethirdweekofexposure.Incontrast,fasting
insulin levels were the same as baseline for the first week, yet were lower
through the third week of exposure and were not accompanied by further
alterations in glucose. The different alterations in these hormones suggest
that multiple adaptive or maladaptive processes may be at play in this
longer-term combined exposure study. The changes in fasted insulin from
the first to the third weeks of exposure are presumably related to impaired
insulin responses to meals during the prolonged exposure segment.
We observed some age-related differences at baseline (for example,
adiposity, RMR, fasted leptin, and body weight), but generally, the
effects of the exposure were age-independent: Both young and older
participants responded to prolonged sleep restriction combined with
circadian disruption with higher glucose levels and lower insulin responses to a standard meal eaten at a consistent circadian phase. We
did observe a differential recovery response by age for RMR and postprandial peak glucose. This general lack of age effect was contrary to our
expectations. We note that we studied healthy nonobese participants to
ensure that comorbidities did not influence results. Thus, our older
participants were very likely to be more healthy than the general older
population at large, in whom responses may be different.
Our study has limitations. Although we did see differences between
the first and the third week of the challenge, to determine the actual
mechanisms underlying these effects, future studies will need to have
more frequent assessments for weeks to months of exposure, and use
challenges such as meal responses, intravenous glucose tolerance tests,
and glucose clamp studies. We did not assess changes by, or control
for, the phase of the menstrual cycle in female participants, but there
were no notable differences by sex or between age groups, possibly suggesting no difference between responses in these younger premenopausal and older postmenopausal women. The weight loss observed
during the sleep restriction and circadian disruption segment may have
been a result of the participants’ relatively underfed state. However, the
average observed weight loss was quite minor (1.2% of body weight during the exposure segment). Moreover, in correlation analyses, the degree
of weight loss in individual participants was not significantly related to
their metabolic changes, and the weight loss persisted during the recovery phase when metabolic responses had returned to baseline. Thus, the
reduction in insulin levels with sleep restriction and circadian disruption in the current study likely occurred via mechanisms unrelated to
changes in body mass or any underfeeding.
Our results suggest that efforts to reduce the health impact and risk
of diabetes in shift workers should focus on improving sleep duration
and circadian realignment strategies to minimize circadian disruption
and desynchrony of central and peripheral circadian oscillators.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
All participants were studied in the Intensive Physiological Monitoring
Unit of the Center for Clinical Investigation at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital (Boston, MA) and provided written informed consent. All procedures were approved by the Partners Human Research Committee
and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Participant recruitment and screening
Healthyadultparticipantswererecruitedusingnewspaperadvertisements,
flyers, and Web site postings. To ensure stable circadian rhythms, participants had no history of regular night shift work for the 3 years before
the study and no history of travel across more than two time zones in the
3 months before the study. Licensed physicians and clinical psychologists
performed physical examinations and psychological screenings. Participants underwent an all-night clinical polysomnogram to rule out sleepdisordered breathing and other sleep disorders. Participants were free of
any disorders of sleep, circadian rhythms, and metabolism and passed a
urine toxicology screen during screening and upon admission to the
inpatient study. Participants received payment for volunteering in this
study, equivalent to ~$10 per hour when in the laboratory.
Prestudy conditions
Participants were instructed to maintain a consistent sleep-wake schedule for at least 21 days (mean, 29.3 ± 12.3 days; range, 21 to 69 days)
before admission with a 10-hour per night scheduled time in bed, at a
self-selected, regular time, and compliance with these instructions was
confirmed by wrist actigraphy for at least 3 weeks before admission
(Actiwatch-L, Mini Mitter). A sleep diary and calls to a time-stamped
phone answering system assured compliance.
Inpatient study conditions
Participants were admitted to the Intensive Physiological Monitoring
Unit of the Center for Clinical Investigation at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital for the 39-day inpatient stay (Fig. 1) in a controlled laboratory
environment free of time cues, maintained at a temperature of 75 ±
3°F. The first 3 days each included a 12-hour nighttime sleep opportunity; days 2 to 4 had a nap near the middle of the normal waking time
to achieve sleep satiation. Days 4 to 6 included a 10-hour nighttime
sleep opportunity (referred to as baseline). This was followed by the
forced desynchrony portion of the protocol, consisting of eighteen,
28-hour sleep-wake cycles with a 21.47-hour wake episode and a 6.53-hour
sleep opportunity (equivalent to 5.6 hours of sleep opportunity per
24 hours) over 3 weeks. For recovery, participants were realigned to
their baseline circadian phase for light-dark, meal, and sleep-wake
cycles, then spent 10 inpatient days each at an entrained circadian

phase with a 10-hour nighttime sleep opportunity before being discharged. During wakefulness, participants were allowed to perform activities such as writing, reading, board or card games, movie viewing, arts
and crafts, listening to or playing music, and mild stretching (exercise was
prohibited). Research technicians observed participants throughout the
study, either by closed-circuit television or by direct observation during
waking episodes throughout the laboratory protocol. Light levels were
maintained at <0.02 lux during sleep opportunities and at <15 lux during
wake episodes to avoid circadian phase–resetting effects of light.
Timing of metabolic assessments and
recovery sleep episodes
During the three stages of the experiment, we made metabolic assessments of at least 24 hours at similar circadian phases (±4 hours), as
determined by CBT collected at 1-min intervals with a rectal thermistor (Measurement Specialties). Circadian period and phase of CBT were
analyzed with nonorthogonal spectral analysis (NOSA), as previously
described (28). NOSA analysis was also used to determine the initial
endogenous CBT minimum. Even though all participants were exposed
to the same 21-day challenge, we wanted to ensure that standardized
metabolic measurements were made in the different conditions at closely
matched central circadian pacemaker phases for each participant. Further, there were slight differences in the intrinsic circadian period among
participants. For these reasons, the measurement period during the challenge segment occurred on slightly different protocol days among the
participants. The average period of the internal circadian pacemaker
was 24.13 ± 0.22 hours (range, 23.46 to 24.50 hours; P = not significant
for age), the average duration of challenge at the time of the metabolic
assessments was 19.2 ± 2.8 24-hour days (range, 15 to 22 days), and the
average difference in circadian phase relative to baseline at the times of
these measurements was +0.7 ± 1.8 hours.
Forced desynchrony (circadian disruption)
metabolic assessments
Upon waking each day during weeks 1 and 3 of the sleep restriction
combined with circadian disruption segment, fasted blood samples
were drawn through an indwelling intravenous catheter for assessment of glucose, insulin, cortisol, leptin, and free ghrelin. By design,
these samples were collected across a range of circadian phases to quantify the acute and chronic effects of both circadian misalignment and
circadian disruption with the scheduled light-dark, feeding-fasting,
and sleep-wake schedule.
Controlled diet
During the inpatient portion of the study, participants received an isocaloric, controlled nutrient diet consisting of 55 to 60% carbohydrate,
15 to 20% protein, 15 to 30% fat, 150 meq Na+ (±20%), 100 meq K+
(±20%), and a minimum of 2.5 liters of fluid per 24 hours. The initial
diet was designed based on the Harris-Benedict equation with an activity factor of 1.4 (46). Each participant was given identical breakfast
meals during the three intensive 24-hour sampling intervals at baseline, at the end of the forced desynchrony, and after 9 days of stable
circadian re-entrainment and recovery sleep. Participants were required
to finish all food. A eucaloric diet was maintained by increasing or
decreasing kilocalories when changes in wake-time, fasted, post-void
weights exceeded 1 kg. Weighed foods confirmed that actual consumed
diet changed from baseline by a mean of only 6 kcal/24 hours during
the forced desynchrony segment.
Resting metabolic rate
A validated and Food and Drug Administration–approved indirect calorimeter (Medgem 100, HealtheTech Inc.) was used to estimate RMR in
kilocalories per day from expired gases (47). Measurements were made
after wake time for 12 to 15 min before standardized breakfasts.
Blood sampling
Fasting blood samples were taken on multiple days throughout the inpatient stay. During the three intensive 24-hour sampling intervals,
blood sampleswere taken every 10 min for an hour after breakfast, every
30 min during the following 2 hours, and hourly at all other times.
Assays
Glucose was assayed with Gluco-quant Glucose/HK kits (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) with a sensitivity of 2 mg/dl, an inter-assay precision
CV (coefficient of variation) of 1.7%, and an intra-assay precision CV
of 1.0%. Insulin and cortisol were assayed with kits from Beckman
Coulter Inc. The insulin assay had a sensitivity of 0.03 mIU/ml, an interassay precision of 3.1 to 5.6%, and an intra-assay precision of 2.0 to
4.2%. The cortisol assay had a sensitivity of 0.4 mg/dl, an inter-assay precision of 6.4 to 7.9%, and an intra-assay precision of 4.4 to 6.7%. Leptin
and active ghrelin were measured with ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits (Millipore Corp.). The leptin assay had a sensitivity
of 0.5 ng/ml for the standard assay (25-ml sample size) and 0.125 ng/ml
for the sensitive assay and an inter-assay precision of 2.6 to 6.2% for the
standard assay and 1.3 to 8.6% for the sensitive assay and an intra-assay
precision of 2.6 to 4.6% for the standard assay and 1.4 to 4.9% for the
sensitive assay. The sensitive assay was used to repeat samples with
results below the threshold of the standard assay. The ghrelin assay
had a sensitivity of 8 pg/ml, an inter-assay precision of 3.5 to 6.6%,
and an intra-assay precision of 1.6 to 3.6%.
Study participants
Of the 24 participants to complete the study protocol, 21 were included
in these analyses: 11 young (5 female; mean, 23 ± 2 years) and 10 older
(5 female; 60 ± 5 years). One participant was excluded from these
analyses because blood samples were not obtained during intensive
sampling intervals due to intravenous sampling difficulties. One young
and one older participant were excluded from these analyses because
their circadian temperature phase on the evaluation day after exposure
to circadian disruption and sleep restriction was >4 hours different
from that at baseline.
Statistical methods
Data are presented as means ± SD unless otherwise indicated. Linear
or generalized mixed-effects models were applied to study the effects
of the history of sleep restriction combined with circadian disruption
on metabolic measures. Participants were treated as random effects.
For studying the postprandial responses (baseline, peak, AUC by the
trapezoidal method, and 90-min profiles), condition (baseline, exposure, recovery), age group, sex, and percent body fat were treated as
fixed effects and were entered into the initial model, but only significant variables are reported in the final models. Because age was a main
interest, age and the interaction of age and condition were retained in
all models. For studying the effect of exposure to the combination of
circadian disruption and sleep restriction on fasted sample measures
during the exposure, we used identical models, adding a term for number of weeks into the exposure (beat cycle). Linear regression models
