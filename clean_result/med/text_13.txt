A prospective study of Candida esophagitis was undertaken to determine the spectrum 
of this disease in a general hospital. During 1 year, in 370 consecutive endoscopies, 27 
patients with Candida esophagitis were detected. The diagnosis was established by 
finding white plaques on endoscopy, yeast organisms on microscopic examination of a 
direct smear from the plaques, and a serum agglutinin titer of at least 1: 160. Of these 27 
patients, 14 had esophageal symptoms. Twelve patients were reendoscoped after 
nystatin or nystatin and tlucytosine therapy. Nine patients showed absence of lesions, a 
negative smear, and disappearance of symptoms. Control patients had no plaques on 
endoscopy. no yeast organisms on microscopical examination of esophageal brushings. 
and a positive titer in 4 to 17% of cases. A minimal agglutinin titer of 1:160 was found in 
4 to 12% of two additional groups of controls. Absence of titer precluded a diagnosis of 
Candida esophagitis. 
Candida infection of the esophagus has been considered a relatively uncommon though specific disease 
entitity. suspected primarily in symptomatic patients 
with oral thrush or underlying debilitating diseases. 1-4 
Radiological examination by\barium swallow· and esophageal biopsy' have been the principal diagnostic procedures. Other endoscopic findings have been rePorted I. • but not emphasized as a method of diagnosis.

Patients and Methods 
During the calendar year of 197:1. there were 20,688 general 
hospital admissions, 688 clinic, and 775 private outpatient 
referrals to the Gastroenterology service. Of the patient population, 90% came from a white middle class socioeconomic 
background. For investigation of upper gastrointestinal symptOms. :170 patients underwent esophagoj(astroduodenoscopy;

and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. 
Twenty-seven patients were suspected of having Candida 
esophagitis by gross appearance at endoscopy. The esophagitis 
was graded on a scale of I to IV; grade I. a few raised white 
plaques up to 2 mm" in size with hyperemia but no edema or 
ulceration (fig. 1); grade II. multiple raised white plaques 
greater than 2 mm in size with hyperemia, edema, but no 
ulceration (fig. 2); grade III. confluent. linear. and nodular 
elevated plaques with hyperemia and frank ulceration (fig. :I); 
grade IV. finding of grade III with increased friability of the 
mucous membranes and occasional narrowing of the lumen 
(fig. 4). 
The plaques were brushed, and direct smears and cultures 
were made from these brushings. The slides were air dried. A 
wet mount was prepared by adding a drop of either distilled

mucus (fig. 5). Cultures were made on Nickerson's medium 
and the species were determined by germ tube fermentation, 
carbohydrate fermentation, and nitrogen assimilation techniques. The brush was first cultured to detect prior contamination with fungi. The biopsy channel was washed with soap 
solution and 95% ethyl alcohol after each procedure and the 
effluents were periodically cultured to detect the presence of 
fungi. A minimum of two biopsies were taken from the 
esophageal plaques and from the intervening areas. Histological specimens were examined after staining by hematoxylin 
and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff methods. Brushings, biopsies, and cultures were taken from 15 patients with the 
appearance of reflux esophagitis and from 18 patients with a 
normal-appearing esophagus. 
Sera from 27 suspected cases of Candida esophagitis, 100 
asymptomatic hospital employees, 164 random in-hospital 
patients, 18 patients with a normal esophagus at endoscopy, 
and 12 patients with reflux esophagitis were tested for Candida 
agglutinins and precipitins.· Quantitative serum immunoglobulins were determined in 14 of the 27 patients with Candida 
esophagitis. 
Esophagograms were performed in 25 patients suspected to 
have Candida esophagitis, owing to the endoscopic appearance 
and mycological findings. 
Twenty-four of the 27 patients were treated for 6 weeks with 
nystatin (Mycostatin, E. R. Squibb & Sons, Princeton, N. J.), 
200,000 units, as a combined gargle and swallow every 1 to 2 hr 
while awake. 7 Three patients were not treated because they 
required emergency surgery. Four patients with persistent 
symptoms had supplementary flucytosine (Ancobon, Roche 
Laboratories, Nutley, N. J.) orally (100 mg per kg of body 
weight per day in four divided doses after meals for 4 to 6 
weeks).· Weekly complete blood counts and SMA 12/60 
procedures were performed to detect any untoward effects of 
treatment. Of 14 patients with dysphagia or odynophagia 12 
were reendoscoped after treatment 1 to 6 times to evaluate the 
effect of therapy. 
Results 
Of the 370 patients who underwent endoscopy, 55 had 
hyperemia of the esophagus, predominantly of the lower 
third. Twenty-seven had elevated white plaques: 7 were 
classified as grade I, 12 as grade II, 6 as grade III, and 2 
as grade IV Candida esophagitis (table 1). The plaques 
were absent in the upper third of the esophagus in all but 
2 cases; 1 had oral thrush, the 2nd had no oral lesions. 
The patient with oral thrush suffered from acute lymNovember 1976

the 2'7 patients were duodenal ulcer (6), gastric ulcer (5), 
erosive gastritis (4), normal upper gastrointestinal tract 
(4), hiatus hernia (3), atrophic gastritis (3), and partial 
gastrectomy (2). Direct smears and cultures from the 
white plaques were positive for Candida in each case. 
Direct smears were negative in all 15 patients with reflux 
esophagitis and in 18 patients with a normal·appearing 
esophagus; however, Candida was cultured from 6 and 
12 patients, respectively. Serum Candida agglutinin 
titers of 1: 160 or greater were present in 100% of the 27 
patients with white plaques, and in 4 to 17% of four 
Control groups (table 2). Candida precipitin titers were 
not helpful in the diagnosis. Serum immunoglobulins 
Were diffusely elevated in 1 patient and normal in 1:3 of 
14 patients studied. 
The biopsies in all 27 patients with white plaques 
showed acute and chronic inflammatory changes. How, 
ever, Candida invasion of the mUCosa was seen only in 3 
of the 8 patients with grade III or IV esophagitis. In the 
15 patients with reflux esophagitis, the biopsies showed 
acute and chronic inflammation with thickening of the 
basal layer and the absence of Candida. The biopsies of 
all 18 patients with a normal·appearing esophagus were 
normal. 
The esophagograms were reviewed by staff radiologists 
and one of the authors (B. K.). Findings suggestive of 
Candida esophagitis were absent. In the severe cases

Discussion 
Candida esophagitis has been recognized to be not an 
uncommon autopsy finding' particularly in oncological 
institutions. I Eras et a1. I mentioned that this antemortem diagnosis was frequently missed in a review of 2517 
autopsy protocols from an oncological institution. They 
found histologically proven Candida esophagitis in 45 
cases. Of these, 14 had a barium study attempted within 
4 weeks of deaths; 3 had abnormal esophagograms, 5 
were inadequate, and 6 were normal despite the presence 
of severe esophagitis. In another oncological institution, 
Jensen et al. 1 studied 98 patients with oral thrush by 
endoscopy. barium swallow, and culture. They found 
esophagitis in 35 patients with a positive culture for 
Candida in all of them. The barium swallow was 
abnormal in 24 of the 32 patients studied. The majority 
of these patients were in poor condition. Moulinier et a1.· 
collected 40 cases of Candida esophagitis that were 
diagnosed by endoscopy. They noted difficulty in demonstrating X-ray abnormalities and they were able to 
find yeast cells in only half of the biopsies. 
The early stages of Candida esophagitis were more 
readily identified in this prospective study by endoscopy, direct smears, and Candida agglutinin titers. A 
careful, detailed history was important, inasmuch as 
symptoms were mild to moderate. Further, the gradation of the endoscopic appearance correlated well with 
the presence or absence of symptoms (table 1). A direct 
smear from the plaques was consistently positive for 
Candida, whereas a direct smear from patients with 
reflux esophagitis was consistently negative. In contrast, 
cultures for Candida were positive in both reflux and 
Candida esophagitis patients. Cultures are useful in 
determining the species and drug sensitivity but do not 
distinguish the pathogen from the commensal in the 
esophagus. A minimal agglutinin titer of 1:160 was 
present in every patient with the characteristic endoscopic appearance and a positive direct smear for 
Candida. A similar agglutinin titer was present in only 4 
to 17% of four groups of controls. Such an agglutinin titer 
may be due to Candida infection in other organs or past 
infection and is, therefore, not diagnostic of Candida 
esophagitis. However, a titer of less than 1:160 militates 
against such a diagnosis.

Esophageal brushings more readily demonstrated 
Candida than did biopsies. Superficially situated Candida in the less severe form may be washed away in the 
fixing process. Biopsy sections from Candida and reflux 
esophagitis are indistinguishable except for the presence 
of Candida, which was noted in only 10% of the former. 
In the absence of a predisposing illness, Candida 
esophagitis is mainly a disease of the elderly. Impairment of three physiological processes may playa role in 
the pathogenesis of the disease. The first is impaired 
immunity, both cellular 10 and humoral; 11 the second 
is impaired esophageal motility; 11 and the third is impaired carbohydrate metabolism 13, .. associated with 
aging. 
Candida esophagitis should always be considered in 
the differential diagnosis of dysphagia and odynophagia. 
Endoscopy, direct smear, and agglutinin titers are more 
valuable diagnostic aids than are the esophagogram and 
biopsy. Inasmuch as nystatin therapy is simple, safe, 
and effective, it is recommended in the treatment of 
Candida esophagitis. 
Addendum 
From January 1,1974 to June 30,1975,1065 additional 
patients were endoscoped; 136 patients had hyperemia 
of the lower third of the esophagus, 61 with white 
plaques and 75 without plaques (reflux esophagitis). 
Each patient with white plaques had a positive direct 
smear for yeasts. Thirty of the 61 patients were tested for 
agglutinin titers and each had a titer of 1:160 or greater. 
Candida invasion was seen microscopically in 5 of 56 
patients that were biopsied. All 5 had grade III or IV 
involvement. The upper third of the esophagus was 
spared in all cases except 3. Two had an underlying 
disease that may predispose to Candida esophagitis, 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia in one and a severe long 
standing diabetes in the other. Oral thrush was present 
in only these 2 patients and not in the rest of the patients 
with Candida esophagitis. Of 61 patients with Candida 
esophagitis, 30 were symptomatic. The symptoms subsided after treatment with nystatin in the 20 patients 
who were available for follow-up. Reendoscopy was 
performed in only 1 patient (grade IV) who showed 
modest improvement with nystatin. 
Of the 75 patients with reflux esophagitis, 74 had 8 
negative direct smear and only 1 had a positive direct 
smear. However, this patient was lost to follow-up and it

could not be determined whether Candida esophagitis 
developed subsequently. Microscopic examination of the 
49 biopsies were made in the 75 patients with reflux 
esophagitis, showing acute and chronic inflammation 
and no yeasts. Agglutinin titers were done in 12 of the 
group; a titer of 1:160 or greater was found in 1 patient.
