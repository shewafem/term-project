SUMMARY
Although Candida albicans is the main cause of fungal esophagitis, other species such as C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. 
stellatoidea have also been implicated. Several studies have identified risk factors for C. albicans esophagitis. However, data for 
non-C. albicans species is still sparse. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of Candida esophagitis in our medical 
centre over an 18-month period. Additionally, we aimed to investigate predisposing conditions for esophageal candidosis caused by 
different Candida species. A total of 21,248 upper gastroscopies were performed in Santa Casa Complexo Hospitalar between January 
2005 and July 2006. The prevalence of Candida esophagitis was 0.74% (n = 158). C. albicans caused the vast majority of infections 
(96.2%), followed by C. tropicalis (2.5%), C. lusitaniae (0.6%) and C. glabrata (0.6%). There were 81 women (51.3%) and 77 men 
(48.7%). No case of mixed infection occurred. Concomitant oral candidosis was documented for 10.8% (n = 17). Most of cases 
(55.1%) involved outpatients. Around one fifth of patients in our cohort had no identifiable risk factors for esophageal candidosis 
(20.8%). Since nearly all infections were caused by C. albicans we were not able to determine risk factors for esophagitis caused by 
other Candida species.

INTRODUCTION
Candida species are the most common agents of fungal esophagitis. 
While this is usually caused by C. albicans21, other species such as C. 
tropicalis, C. krusei and C. stellatoidea have also been involved16. Risk 
factors for Candida esophagitis have been documented in several series. 
These include pharmacological suppression of gastric acid production1,2,13, 
use of antibiotics24,28, previous vagotomy4,7,8, functional or mechanical 
esophageal abnormalities28,30, and endocrine diseases such as diabetes 
mellitus, hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism11,18. Malnutrition, 
alcoholism, advanced age26,27,28, and therapy with corticosteroids - either 
systemic or inhaled - has also been implicated2,22. However, there are very 
limited data from Brazilian patients. In addition, very little is known for 
infections caused by species other than C. albicans. This study aims to 
document the species distribution in patients with Candida esophagitis 
over an 18-month period (2005-2006) in a single medical centre. We were 
particularly interested in the comparison of risk factors for esophageal 
candidosis amongst patients infected by different Candida species.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
This study was performed between January 2005 and July 2006 
at Santa Casa Complexo Hospitalar, an university tertiary hospital 
with 1,200 beds located in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil. Esophageal 
candidosis was defined by the recovery of Candida species from either 
esophageal brushing or a biopsy of the esophagus performed during 
upper gastroscopy. Esophageal candidosis was endoscopically confirmed 
in the presence of typical sparse or coalescent white plates covering the 
esophageal mucosa. Only cases of endoscopically-confirmed Candida 
esophagitis were included, so patients considered to be only colonized 
by Candida species were excluded. Since this was a retrospective study, 
neither clinical symptoms nor reason for performing endoscopy was 
evaluated. All samples obtained endoscopically were sent in saline 
solution to the Mycology laboratory. The germ tube test was used to 
differentiate C. albicans from other Candida species, which were in turn 
identified with ID 32C (bioMérieux Marcy l’Étoile, France).
Medical records of patients with Candida esophagitis, were reviewed 
to identify potential risk factors for the infections, presented in the 30 days 
preceding the endoscopic procedure. Chronic therapy with corticosteroids 
was considered when patients were in use of 20 mg of prednisone of 
equivalent for >14 days.
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software. Categorical 
variables were compared using the chi-square and the Fisher’s exact 
tests, and p values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The 
study received ethical approval by the hospital’s research ethic board 
(protocol number1000/05).

RESULTS
During the period of study 21,248 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies 
were performed in our medical centre. The prevalence of fungal 
esophagitis was 0.8% (n = 163). Five patients were excluded - four 
due to lack of clinical data and one because the infection was caused 
by Saccharomyces cerevisae. The vast majority of infections for the 
remaining 158 patients were caused by C. albicans (96.2%), followed by 
C. tropicalis (2.5%), C. lusitaniae (0.6%) and C. glabrata (0.6%). There 
were 81 women (51.3%) and 77 men (48.7%). All patients were adults, 
with ages ranging from 21-88 years old (mean 57.4; standard deviation 
16.7 years). No case of mixed fungal infection occurred. Concomitant 
oral candidosis was documented for 10.8% (n = 17). Most of cases 
(55.1%) involved outpatients.
The majority of patients (79.2%) had at least one identifiable risk 
factor for esophageal candidosis. Median number of risk factors per 
patient was 1.0 (range, 1-6). As shown in Table 1, no difference was 
observed in the distribution of risk factors for esophageal candidosis 
when Candida species were considered.
DISCUSSION
The prevalence of fungal esophagitis in this study involving 21,248 
patients submitted to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was 0.77%. 
Similar frequencies have been reported in other series14,17,25. We observed 
in our study that virtually all cases of fungal esophagitis were caused by 
Candida species, with one rare case due to S. cerevisae.
Although esophageal candidosis is a common opportunistic infection 
in patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)23, the 
vast majority of patients in our series (93.7%) were not infected by this 
virus. Since this was a retrospective study, the importance of this variable 
might be underestimated. However, other authors have demonstrated a 
marked reduction in the prevalence of esophageal candidosis in HIV 
patients over the last decade, justified by the immunological benefit 
obtained from antiretroviral therapy10,15,19. 
Around one fifth of patients in our cohort had no identifiable risk 
factors for esophageal candidosis (20.8%). It has been demonstrated 
that esophageal candidosis can occur in healthy individuals14. Still the 
mechanisms of infection in these patients are not clear6,16. Candida species 
are known to colonize the esophagus of 20% of healthy adults12,22. In the 
series by MIMIDIS et al., 36% of patients had no evident risk factor for 
esophageal candidosis14. Interestingly, we observed that 50% of patients 
infected by species other than C. albicans showed no evident predisposing 
condition for the infection. Due to the limited number of patients with 
non-C. albicans infection (n = 6), we were not able to show any difference 
of statistical significance. The clinical or biological importance of this, 
however, is unknown. In addition it should be noted that, due to the 
retrospective nature of our study, some data may be missing. In particular, 
immunological or endocrine conditions predisposing patients to chronic 
mucocutaneous candidosis were not systematically investigated20.
In conclusion, we found C. albicans to be the main etiology of fugal 
esophagitis in our medical centre. Most of patients had one evident 
predisposing condition for Candida esophagitis, and HIV infection 
was quite uncommon. The occurrence of non-C. albicans infections 
in patients with no obvious risk factors for these conditions deserves 
further investigation.

18 meses, além de comparar condições predisponentes para candidose 
esofágica causadas por diferentes espécies de Candida. De janeiro 
de 2005 a julho de 2006, 21.248 endoscopias digestivas altas foram 
realizadas no Complexo Hospitalar Santa Casa (Porto Alegre, Brasil). 
A prevalência de esofagite por Candida foi de 0,74% (n = 158). C. 
albicans foi a causadora da maioria das infecções (96,2%), seguida por C. 
tropicalis (2,5%), C. lusitaniae (0,6%) e C. glabrata (0,6%). Candidose 
oral concomitante foi documentada em 10,8% (n = 17). Cerca de 21% 
dos pacientes não teve qualquer fator de risco identificável para candidose 
esofágica. Em função do pequeno número de pacientes infectados por 
espécies não-Candida albicans, não foi possível determinarmos fatores 
de risco para estas infecções.
