A more plausible explanation for this early and rapid
cardiac failure is related to the low cardiac output syndrome, which is seen in up to 28% of patients with
chronic constrictive pericarditis after undergoing pericardiectomy [9, 10]. It is believed that the postoperative
myocardial dysfunction in this setting is related to myocardial atrophy. The chronic external support of the heart
by the tight pericardium and ﬂuid when released may
allow the heart to overdilate rapidly, leading to systolic dysfunction and heart failure. If this pathophysiologic mechanism also occurs in some patients with
acute tamponade, then the suggestion by Neelakandan
and associates [6] for gradual decompression of the
pericardial effusion may have some merit, although the
practical implementation of this suggestion may be difﬁcult. Presumably pericardiocentesis with gradual removal of pericardial ﬂuid with an indwelling catheter
might be a feasible approach. However, this syndrome,
no matter how lethal, is relatively rare and recommendations on prevention will await characterization of the
patients at risk. Therefore, at present until more information is available, we recommend only that anesthesiologists, cardiologists, and thoracic surgeons be aware of
the possibility that their patient might develop transient
or even fatal heart failure after relief of a benign or
malignant pericardial tamponade, similar to that seen in
our patient. Treatment for this problem should be supportive with appropriate invasive monitoring and inotropic support, which will result in recovery in some
patients.
