Projection of the year 2050 burden of diabetes in
the US adult population: dynamic modeling of
incidence, mortality, and prediabetes prevalence
James P Boyle1, Theodore J Thompson1*, Edward W Gregg1, Lawrence E Barker1, David F Williamson2
Abstract
Background: People with diabetes can suffer from diverse complications that seriously erode quality of life.
Diabetes, costing the United States more than $174 billion per year in 2007, is expected to take an increasingly
large financial toll in subsequent years. Accurate projections of diabetes burden are essential to policymakers
planning for future health care needs and costs.
Methods: Using data on prediabetes and diabetes prevalence in the United States, forecasted incidence, and
current US Census projections of mortality and migration, the authors constructed a series of dynamic models
employing systems of difference equations to project the future burden of diabetes among US adults. A threestate model partitions the US population into no diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and diagnosed diabetes. A fourstate model divides the state of “no diabetes” into high-risk (prediabetes) and low-risk (normal glucose) states. A
five-state model incorporates an intervention designed to prevent or delay diabetes in adults at high risk.
Results: The authors project that annual diagnosed diabetes incidence (new cases) will increase from about 8
cases per 1,000 in 2008 to about 15 in 2050. Assuming low incidence and relatively high diabetes mortality, total
diabetes prevalence (diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) is projected to increase from 14% in 2010 to 21% of the
US adult population by 2050. However, if recent increases in diabetes incidence continue and diabetes mortality is
relatively low, prevalence will increase to 33% by 2050. A middle-ground scenario projects a prevalence of 25% to
28% by 2050. Intervention can reduce, but not eliminate, increases in diabetes prevalence.
Conclusions: These projected increases are largely attributable to the aging of the US population, increasing
numbers of members of higher-risk minority groups in the population, and people with diabetes living longer.
Effective strategies will need to be undertaken to moderate the impact of these factors on national diabetes
burden. Our analysis suggests that widespread implementation of reasonably effective preventive interventions
focused on high-risk subgroups of the population can considerably reduce, but not eliminate, future increases in
diabetes prevalence.
Background
People with diabetes often develop diverse microvascular, macrovascular, and neuropathic complications that
seriously erode quality of life. The high prevalence, high
incidence, chronicity, and long-term implications for
health and health care costs make diabetes a major concern for the United States and much of the developed
and developing world [1,2]. In 2007, diabetes cost the
US in excess of $174 billion [3]. Diabetes is expected to
take an increasingly large financial toll in the future,
particularly on older adults in developed countries and
on working-age adults in developing countries [4].
Accurate projections of diabetes burden are essential to
policymakers planning for future health care needs and
costs.
Several future projections of the prevalence, incidence,
and total number of diabetes cases for the US and other
countries have been carried out [5-8]. However, previous
estimates for the US are likely to be outdated because

they relied on 1990 census projections. These older census projections overestimate current mortality rates and
do not account for the increasing size of the Hispanic
and foreign-born US populations at higher risk for
developing diabetes. Previous estimates assumed no
increase in diabetes incidence and did not consider the
impact of undiagnosed diabetes on total diabetes prevalence. In addition, earlier estimates ignored the substantial variation in diabetes incidence occurring between
the subpopulation with normal glucose levels and the
subpopulation with prediabetes.
To overcome these limitations and provide contemporary, realistic estimates of the growth of the national
diabetes burden, we constructed a system of dynamic
equations that incorporate initial prevalence (percentage
of population with diabetes, both diagnosed and undiagnosed), incidence (percentage of population with newly
diagnosed diabetes), migration, mortality, and prevalence
of prediabetes. These equations model the future burden
of diabetes on US adults through 2050. We also consider the effect of a hypothetical, large-scale preventive
intervention.
Materials and methods
Data sources
The data sources for this study include the US Census
Bureau [9] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [10]. Census data are based on the 2000
census and include estimates of the 2007 population
and estimates of mortality rates, net migration, and
births from 2008 through 2050. CDC data include estimates and standard errors of incidence rates of diagnosed diabetes for the US adult population (aged 18-79
years) from 1980 through 2007. The application of these
data depended on a transition matrix that was based on
a literature review. This matrix contains estimates of the
rates of transition from having no diabetes, prediabetes,
and undiagnosed diabetes to having diagnosed diabetes,
as well as the risk of mortality associated with different
glycemic and diabetic states.
Incidence projections
Let the annual incidence rate of diagnosed diabetes and
its estimated standard error be denoted by (yt, st) for t =
1,...,28, corresponding to years 1980 through 2007. We
fit a logistic growth curve with asymptote r using Bayesian methods [11]. The logistic growth curve restricts
incidence rates to be monotonic over time. An informative prior distribution, putting approximately 95% of its
mass between the 2007 US rate ( 0.0078) and the Pima
Indian rate (0.025) [12] was used for r. The Pima Indian
incidence rate was used because the Pima have the highest diabetes incidence among subpopulations of the US.
A normal distribution was assumed for yt Incidence
projections are denoted as μt for t = 29,...,71, corresponding to years 2008 through 2050. This model is

Diffuse normal prior distributions were used for l0 and
l1. Four different specifications for εt were considered:
unstructured, first order autoregressive (AR(1)), first
order moving average (MA(1)), and first order autoregressive-moving average (ARMA(1,1)). Graphical displays
of the posterior distributions of the residuals, yt - μt, and
the residual sum of squares were used to compare models. The AR(1) and ARMA(1,1) were indistinguishable
and clearly fit better than the unstructured and MA(1)
models. We used the AR(1) model because it contains
fewer parameters than the ARMA(1,1) model. The AR(1)
model’s residuals did not exhibit serial correlation and
were all less than 0.0005 in absolute value, indicating
good model fit. Posterior distributions of the projected
incidences of diagnosed diabetes are simulated as part
of the model fitting process. Modeling was done using
WinBUGS software [13].
Diabetes projections
We constructed a series of dynamic models that consisted of systems of difference equations in time that are
similar to models described elsewhere [14,15] to project
the future burden of diabetes in the United States. These
models incorporated initial US prevalence, modeled incidence projections, census-based mortality projections,
and a time-varying transition matrix that differentially
allotted the population into states of normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, and undiagnosed diabetes/diagnosed
diabetes. A three-state model partitioned the US adult
population into the states of no diabetes, undiagnosed
diabetes, and diagnosed diabetes so that the projected
total adult population would agree with census projections. A four-state model extended the three-state model
by splitting the adult population with no diabetes into
high- and low-risk groups. Finally, we present preliminary results from a five-state model that represents the
potential effect of a hypothetical preventive intervention
delivered to all people with impaired fasting glucose
(IFG), a group at high risk for future development of diabetes. If half of the people with IFG participated in an
intervention and their incidence was reduced by 50%, it
would be roughly equivalent to a 25% reduction in all
people with IFG. Therefore, we assumed that the
hypothetical intervention would reduce by 25% the
annual incidence of diabetes in people with IFG.

Key assumptions for the models follow. First, people
cannot move from diabetes to nondiabetes; this assumption is reasonable because remission is extremely rare.
Second, the relative risks of death for the two diabetes
states versus the no diabetes state are constant over
time. The number of ways that relative risk might vary
over time is infinite. In the absence of data about which
of these patterns of varying relative risk to choose, we
chose the simplest one: no time variation. Third, the
transition rates to diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes
for nondiabetics are constant multiples of the transition
rate to diagnosed diabetes for undiagnosed diabetics.
This assumption implies the proportion of diagnosed
diabetics among all new diabetics in any given year is
constant over time.
A detailed description of these models, including all
assumptions, references for key parameter estimates,
and algebraic derivations, are presented in Appendix 1
and Appendix 2. The programs for implementing the
models were written in GAUSS [16].
Results
Figure 1 plots the historical incident cases of diagnosed
diabetes per 1,000 people for 1980 through 2007. It also
plots three projection scenarios for 2008 through 2050:
low incidence, which is the 2.5th percentile of the posterior distribution; middle incidence, which is the posterior
mean; and high incidence, which is the 97.5th percentile
of the posterior distribution. Historical incidence rates
range from 3.3 cases per 1,000 in 1980 to 7.8 cases per
1,000 in 2007. The middle incidence scenario increases
steadily over the projection horizon, from 8.4 cases per
1,000 in 2008 to 14.7 cases per 1,000 in 2050. The low
incidence scenario remains relatively flat, with an average
incidence of 8.4 cases per 1,000, while the high incidence
scenario projects extreme increases in incidence from 9.2
to 22.9 cases per 1,000 for the years 2008 through 2050.
We denote the relative risk of death for individuals
with undiagnosed diabetes versus those without diabetes
as r1 and the relative risk of death for individuals with
diagnosed diabetes versus those without diabetes as r2.
Published results [17] lead to estimates r1 = 1.77 and
r2 = 2.11, and we refer to this set of values as low mortality risk. We also set r1 = 1.00 and r2 = 4.08, consistent with projections from Narayan et al [7] aggregated
to the US adult population aged 18-79 years, and we
refer to this set of values as high mortality risk (see
Appendix 1 for more details).

Table 1 provides projections of the numbers (in millions) of people with no diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes,
or diagnosed diabetes every fifth year from 2010 through
2050. We provide projections for the low and middle
incidence scenarios, both for low mortality risk and high
mortality risk, for four scenarios. Results for the high
incidence projections are reported in this section only.
All four model scenarios indicate at least a doubling,
and in some cases an even greater increase, in the number of people with diagnosed diabetes from 2010
through 2050. When compared to this rapid growth, the
projected number of people with undiagnosed diabetes
grows slowly under all four scenarios. In Figure 2, the
prevalence of any diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed)
increases from 14.1%-14.5% in 2010 to 24.7%, 20.5%,
32.8%, and 28.3% in 2050 under, respectively, the low
incidence scenarios (low and high mortality risk) and
middle incidence scenarios (low and high mortality risk).
Table 2 (all results in thousands) displays results from
the hypothetical preventive intervention assessing the
impact of intervention on diabetes incidence. The fourth
column displays the number of incident cases of diabetes under the low and middle incidence scenarios
with low and high mortality risk. The fifth column does
the same for the number of incident cases and assumes
that our hypothetical intervention is in place. The sixth
column displays the difference between the fifth and
sixth columns, which is the number of incident cases
the intervention prevented or delayed. For example,
using the projected middle incidence scenario and low
mortality risk, 3,490,900 incident cases would be
reported in 2050 with no intervention and 3,146,100
incident cases would be reported with intervention, for
a net reduction of 344,800 incident cases of diabetes.
Discussion
Our estimates of diabetes prevalence paint a sobering
picture of the future growth of diabetes. Under an
assumption of low incidence and relatively high diabetes
mortality, total prevalence is projected to increase to
21% of the US adult population by 2050. On the other
hand, if recent increases in diabetes incidence continue
(middle incidence projections) and diabetes mortality
ratios are relatively low, diabetes prevalence will increase
to 33% by 2050. The middle-ground (low incidence with
low mortality or middle incidence with high mortality)
scenarios project a prevalence of 25% to 28% by 2050.
In each of the scenarios, the increases are, in part, attributable to demographic changes. The population of the
United States is aging, and older adults are more likely
to develop diabetes than younger adults. The size of
minority populations in the United States also is growing, and some minorities are at greater risk of developing diabetes than non-Hispanic whites. Finally, mortality

among people with diabetes is declining. The result is
that people with diabetes live longer and contribute to
prevalence for longer periods of time.
Two previous diabetes forecasts have linearly extrapolated historical prevalence trends. In 2004, Wild et al
[18] projected a 114% increase in the number of people
with diabetes from 2000 through 2030 worldwide. More
recent estimates on behalf of the International Diabetes
Federation suggested that, from 2010 through 2030,
increases in diabetes prevalence will range from a 20%
increase in Europe to an almost doubling of prevalence
in Africa and the Middle East [4]. Others have built
dynamic models incorporating incidence, mortality, and
migration. A discrete, three-state Markov model that
stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity projected an
approximate doubling in US prevalence by 2050 [6,7]. In
2007, a model using NHANES III as a starting point and
a midstream validation using NHANES 1999-2002 data
projected an approximate 50% increase in the next 20
years in the United States [19]. Magliano et al [20] projected diabetes prevalence in Australia increasing from
10.1% in 2010 to 17.0% in 2025, a trend similar to our
low incidence-high mortality risk results.
Our models, which include the ability to evaluate preventive interventions, suggest that the future prevalence
of diagnosed diabetes could be significantly worse than
previously suggested. A large increase in diabetes prevalence could be driven by multiple factors, including
increasing incidence, better detection, and in-migration.
Our updated model includes a higher level of incidence
based on the CDC National Diabetes Surveillance System and projects lower future mortality rates than were
used in previous models based on US Census data. In
addition, our model assumes that the mortality rate of
the diabetic population will decline at least as much as
that of the nondiabetic population (i.e., the mortality
rate ratio associated with diabetes will be constant).
Recent comparison of US cohorts suggests that this
assumption is reasonable [21].
The projected loss in quality of life and the projected
costs of providing health care could be significant.
Increased efforts in primary prevention of diabetes can
help to decrease loss in quality of life and the future
cost of providing care for people with diabetes. Indeed,
such efforts are essential if we hope to moderate or slow
the growth of diabetes prevalence. However, as Table 2
indicates, prevention efforts can be reasonably expected
to moderate, but not prevent, future growth in the number of people with the disease.
Our five-state model made the assumption that a
hypothetical intervention would reach 100% of those with
IFG and would reduce the annual incidence of diabetes in
this group by 25%. Future efforts to refine our modeling
approach will focus on more realistic specification of
intervention scenarios applied to a variety of population
subgroups at high risk of developing diabetes. Had we
split the population at high risk into intervention and nonintervention subsets, we would have obtained estimates
between the no intervention and intervention cases in
Table 2. Thus, column six of Table 2 can be viewed as an
upper bound on the number of incident diabetes cases
that a hypothetical intervention could prevent.
Our model is subject to several limitations. Cases of
diabetes in people younger than age 18 or older than
age 79 years were not considered. Although diabetes in
the young is rare, and a relatively small portion of the
US population is aged 80 years or older, these numbers
might not be negligible. Our model made many reasonable but untestable assumptions. For example, we
assumed that the relative risks of death for those with
detected or undetected diabetes, compared to those
without diabetes, are constant over time. We assumed
that the observed increase in diabetes incidence fits a
logistic growth curve. Given the logistic model, we
could have chosen either a more or less precise prior
for r. While assumptions other than the ones we made
could have been made, we are aware of no data sources
that would support such assumptions. We assumed that
census estimates for the intercensal years between 2000
and 2009 and the census projections of net migration,
births, and death rates for 2010 and beyond are accurate. We also assumed no feedback effect; for example,
the increasing prevalence of diabetes could conceivably
contribute to greater awareness of diabetes, which
could, in turn, reduce the incidence rate or could result
in fewer cases of diabetes remaining undiagnosed.
Finally, our model implicitly assumes that the future will
resemble the past. Changes in the levels of circulating
glucose or A1c considered to define diabetes could
change the prevalence of both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. Major upheavals, such as an epidemic or
natural disaster that substantially changed birth or death
rates or a dramatic social change that invalidated census
projections or caused other changes in the way people
lead their lives, could have correspondingly major
impacts on the outcomes of our model.
We performed a sensitivity analysis that assumed 98%
prior probability for r, the asymptote of the incidence,
in the interval (0.0078, 0.025). The sensitivity analysis
produced no practical difference in the incidence projections. We also investigated the sensitivity of our model
by considering low mortality risk, high mortality risk,
middle incidence projections, and low incidence projections. The additional model assumptions are justified in
the appendices. A formal sensitivity analysis of all
assumptions would present a substantial technical challenge. We believe it is more useful to policymakers for
us to present the results of our four model scenarios.

We anticipate that the modeling methods described
here could be used by other countries, especially those
with reliable census estimates, to estimate future diabetes burden, as well as the potential effects of interventions to reduce disease burden. Country-specific data
elements could be easily substituted for the data elements we used to develop a model that fit US population dynamics. Further, a modified form of this model
might be applicable to other chronic, near-irreversible,
and sometimes undiagnosed conditions such as heart
disease.
Conclusion
We project that, over the next 40 years, the prevalence
of total diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed) in the
United States will increase from its current level of
about 1 in 10 adults to between 1 in 5 and 1 in 3 adults
in 2050. The health care costs of a person with diagnosed diabetes are approximately 2.3 times that of a
person without [3]. Although a formal projection of
costs is beyond the scope of this analysis, the total societal cost of diabetes is likely to dramatically increase over
the coming decades. The increases in diabetes prevalence projected here are largely attributable to a combination of three key demographic factors, including aging
of the US population, increasing size of higher-risk minority populations, and declining mortality among people
with diabetes. Although these demographic factors
reflect underlying improvements in the health of the US
population, effective strategies will need to be undertaken to moderate the impact of these factors on national
diabetes burden. Our analysis suggests that widespread
implementation of reasonably effective preventive interventions focused on high-risk subgroups of the population may not eliminate, but might considerably reduce,
future increases in diabetes prevalence.
Appendix 1
Three-state model
The US adult population is modeled at 1-year intervals
starting at year t = 28 (2007) and ending at t = 71
(2050). Specifically, define the following numbers of
people in various states, rates, and flows. All rates are
annual and flows occur during year t, i.e., in the interval
(t-1,t].
X(t) = the number of adults without diabetes at time
= t.
Z(t) = the number of adults with undiagnosed diabetes
at time = t.
Y(t) = the number of adults with diagnosed diabetes at
time = t.
b(t) = Census projection of the number of adults turning 18 (births) during year t.
m(t) = Census projection of the number of adults
migrating into the United States during year t.
d(t) = Census projected death rate for the US resident
population aged 18-79 years.
g(t) = nondiabetes death rate among X(t-1).
r1g(t) = diabetes death rate among Z(t-1); r2g(t) = diabetes death rate among Y(t-1); r1 and r2 are relative
risks.
i(t) = incidence rate of diagnosed diabetes among X(t-1)
or Z(t-1), denoted earlier by y t
∧
.
I(t)= incidence rate of all diabetes (undiagnosed or
diagnosed) among X(t-1).
fx(t) = proportion of b(t) without diabetes.
fz(t) = proportion of b(t) with undiagnosed diabetes.
fy(t) = proportion of b(t) with diagnosed diabetes.
gx(t) = proportion of m(t) without diabetes.
gz(t) = proportion of m(t) with undiagnosed diabetes.
gy(t) = proportion of m(t) with diagnosed diabetes.
The relations fx(t)+ fz(t)+ fy(t) = 1 and gx(t)+ gz(t)+ gy
(t) = 1 ensure consistency with the census projections.

Note that this matrix displays the distribution of the
beginning year stocks (rows) to the ending year stocks
(the columns), and thus, the transition rates in each row
must be nonnegative and add to unity for each year t.
Some assumptions about transition rates are apparent.
First, people cannot move from diabetes to nondiabetes;
this assumption is reasonable because remission is extremely rare. Second, the relative risks of death for the two
diabetes states are constant over time. No data were
found to support time varying relative risks, but published results [17] lead to estimates r1 = 1.77 and r2 =
2.11. We also set r1 = 1.00 and r2 = 4.08 in a sensitivity
analysis, consistent with projections from Narayan et al
[6] aggregated to the US adult population aged 18-79
years. Third, the transition rates to diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes for nondiabetics are constant multiples of
the transition rate to diagnosed diabetes for undiagnosed
diabetics. General time varying rates for these transitions
were not available, but, as detailed below, estimates of
Boyle et al. Population Health Metrics 2010, 8:29

ξ1 and ξ2 could be obtained. This assumption implies the
proportion of diagnosed diabetics among all new diabetics in any given year t is constant over time, i.e.,

. To calculate
h, assume that 95% of the time a person spends less than
seven years in the undiagnosed diabetes state [22] and
that the hazard rate for moving from undiagnosed to
diagnosed diabetes is constant over time. This equates to
a 0.19 probability of moving to the diabetes state within
six months. The transition matrix leads to the system of

The first set of equations reflects our baseline assumption that all incoming births are nondiabetic. The second
set of equations simply distributes the net migration for

beginning of the year. All parameters in the model are
thus determined and the system of equations described
earlier can be used to calculate the model projections.
Four-state model
The four-state model expands the three-state model by
splitting X(t) = HX(t) + LX(t), where HX(t) = p(t)X(t) is
the number of adults in a high-risk group (e.g., those
with IFG) and LX(t) = [1-p(t)] X(t) is the number in a
low-risk group (e.g., those without IFG). This must be
done so that X(t), Z(t), and Y(t) are as in the three-state
model.

For the risk strata IFG, this gives c = 6.6. All of this
ensures that the relevant transition rates from the nondiabetic population to the diabetic population are the same as
in the three-state model. Since death rates for these populations are as in the three-state model, the four-state
model properly expands the three-state model when

Five state model (preventive intervention)
Given the outputs from the two previous baseline models, consider the following transition matrix reflecting
intervention on the high-risk population. Note that IX(t)
now denotes the number of people in the high-risk or
intervention group. Also, a new state has been added
with LXI(t) equals the number of people in the intervention group who have regressed to low risk. The transition matrix is

State variables are relabeled because we expect the
intervention model to deviate from the previous models.
The initial conditions are the same as in the four-state
model, with LXI(28) = 0. The associated system of difference equations is omitted and can be derived in the
same way as in the previous two models.
Appendix 2
There are no published nationally representative estimates for annual incidence of total diabetes (diagnosed
or undiagnosed) for the US adult nondiabetic population
or for subgroups defined by glycemic level. The one US
estimate of diabetes incidence in 2007 for adults aged
18-79 (0.78%) applies only to diagnosed diabetes [10].
Therefore, we developed our own estimates of the
annual incidence of total diabetes for the US nondiabetic adult population.
Groups defined by glycemic level
Diabetes incidence in the entire population is a function
of diabetes incidence in four mutually exclusive glycemic
subgroups and their prevalence in the nondiabetic population. These subgroups are 1) Normoglycemic (NG):
fasting blood glucose < 100 mg/dl and 2-hour postchallenge glucose < 140 mg/dl; 2) Isolated Impaired
Fasting Glucose (IIFG): fasting blood glucose 100-125
mg/dl with 2-hour post-challenge blood glucose < 140
mg/dl; 3) Isolated Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IIGT):
2-hour post-challenge blood glucose 140-199 mg/dl with
fasting blood glucose < 100 mg/dl; 4) Combined IGT
and IFG (CIFGT): fasting blood glucose 100-125 mg/dl
with 2-hour post-challenge blood glucose 140-199 mg/
dl. We used 2005-2006 NHANES data, after excluding
people with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes, to
estimate glycemic group prevalences for the nondiabetic
US adult population.
Gerstein et al [24] published estimates of the annualized relative risks of diabetes for IIFG, IIGT, and CIFGT
with the NG subgroup as referent, but did not report
the absolute annual incidence for the NG subgroup. To
calculate the absolute incidence for each glycemic subgroup, the relative risk must be multiplied by the absolute incidence in the NG subgroup.
Annual incidence in the normoglycemic
Santaguida et al [25] reported annualized incidence of
diabetes from 42 studies in which the NG subgroup was
included. We used 1999-2006 NHANES data to estimate
that, among US adults aged ≥20 years, the mean age of
the NG subgroup was 46 years. Four studies included by
Santaguida et al reported a mean age of 43-48 years.
One of these studies was on US Pima Indians, who are

believed to have the world’s highest diabetes incidence,
and this study was excluded. We also identified one
study published after Santaguida et al that reported a
mean age of 50 years in the NG subgroup [20].
The annualized diabetes incidence for the NG subgroup from the four studies was 0.19%, 0.25%, 0.38%,
and 0.64%. We used the median annual incidence of
these four studies, 0.32%, to estimate diabetes incidence
in the NG subgroup in the United States. Engberg et al
[26] recently reported a nearly identical estimate of
annual incidence of 0.3% for an NG subgroup from a
population-based cohort in northern Europe with a
mean age of 46 years.
Annual incidence for dysglycemic subgroups
We multiplied the 0.32% annual diabetes incidence in
the NG subgroup by the relative risks from Gerstein
et al [24] of 5.5 (IIGT), 7.5 (IIFG), and 12.1 (CIFGT).
The result was annual incidences of 1.76% (IIGT), 2.40%
(IIFG), and 3.87% (CIFGT).
Annual incidence in the total population
We multiplied the annual diabetes incidence of each
independent glycemic subgroup (NG, IIGT, IIFG, and
CIFGT) by its prevalence in the US nondiabetic population and summed the result, yielding an estimate of
annual diabetes incidence of 1.06%. This finding is similar to that reported by recent population-based cohort
studies. Bonora et al [27] studied adults aged 40-79
years in northeastern Italy and concluded that “...~1% of
European white individuals aged 40-79 years develop
Type 2 diabetes annually...” Maskarinec et al [28] studied a multi-ethnic sample of adults aged 45 -74 years
in Hawaii and estimated an annual diabetes incidence of
1.04%.
