Evidence for a Circadian Rhythm of Insulin Sensitivity
in Patients With NIDDM Caused by Cyclic Changes in
Hepatic Glucose Production
Guenther Boden, Xinhua Chen, and Jean Luc Urbain
Diurnal variation in insulin sensitivity in patients with
NIDDM has long been suspected but has been difficult
to document mainly because of the interdependence of
changes in glucose and insulin. Stable serum insulin
levels during hyperglycemic clamping in patients with
NIDDM in the present study provided the opportunity
to examine changes in insulin sensitivity unaffected by
changes in blood glucose and insulin concentrations.
Six patients with NIDDM (four men and two women,
BMI 33.9 ± 2.5) underwent hyperglycemic (11.1 mmol/1,
—200 mg/dl) clamping for 72 h. Measured were serum
insulin, free fatty acid (FFA), cortisol, and growth
hormone concentrations and rates of insulin secretion,
insulin clearance, and glucose infusion rate (GIR)
needed to maintain hyperglycemia. In addition, five patients (three men and two women, BMI 32.6 ± 0.6)
underwent hyperglycemic clamping for 24 h with hourly
determinations of hepatic glucose production (HGP)
and glucose disappearance rates (GRd). GIR, reflecting
insulin sensitivity, changed rhythmically with a cycle
duration of 22.9 ± 1.4 h and an amplitude of 47.8 ±
11.2%. GIR was lowest at 8:31 a.m. (±52 min) and
highest at 7:04 p.m. (±58 min). Circadian changes in
GIR were completely accounted for by changes in HGP,
while GRd remained unchanged. Plasma levels of FFAs
and cortisol also exhibited circadian fluctuations, and
their blood levels correlated negatively with GIR (r =
-0.72 and -0.64, respectively). We concluded that
insulin sensitivity in patients with NIDDM changed
with circadian (—24 h) rhythmicity (decreasing during
the night and increasing during the day). These changes
were unrelated to blood levels of glucose and insulin,
insulin clearance, exercise, food intake, and sleep.
They were caused by circadian changes in HGP, which
in turn were closely correlated with circadian changes
in blood FFA and cortisol levels. We believe that recognition of these circadian changes has implications for
the diagnosis and the treatment of patients with
NIDDM. Diabetes 45:1044-1050, 1996

T
he existence of diurnal variations in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in normal and diabetic
subjects has been suspected for decades. The
older literature contains numerous reports of diurnal changes in plasma glucose and in glucose tolerance (1).
These reports, however, were often contradictory. Glucose
tolerance was found to be better in the morning in some (2,3)
and better in the afternoon in others (4,5). More recently,
several groups have reported early morning increases in
insulin requirements in patients with IDDM, which suggested
an early morning decrease in insulin sensitivity or alternatively an increase in insulin clearance (6-8). The short
duration of these studies (one night), however, did not permit recognition of diurnal changes. A major problem complicating studies of cyclic changes in insulin sensitivity has
been the strong interdependence between glucose concentrations and insulin secretion (1). For instance, if there was
a primary change in glucose concentration, it would produce
an isodirectional change in insulin, which then would modify
the glucose concentration. On the other hand, a primary
change in insulin concentration would inversely affect glucose, which would then modify the insulin concentration.
Because of this chicken-and-egg situation, it has remained
uncertain whether or not there is a truly diurnal rhythm of
insulin sensitivity in patients with IDDM or NIDDM.
The findings in the present study that patients with
NIDDM, in contrast to normal volunteers (9), have stable
insulin levels during hyperglycemic clamping has allowed us
to determine whether these patients have cyclic changes of
insulin sensitivity unrelated to changes in blood glucose or
insulin levels.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Subjects. The clinical characteristics of the patients with NIDDM
participating in these studies are shown in Table 1. All patients had been
treated with sulfonylurea drugs, and five patients received in addition
small doses of NPH insulin (5-15 U) at bedtime. Insulin and all other
medications were discontinued at least 1 day before the studies. The
patients' weights were stable for at least 2 months, and their diets
contained a minimum of 250 g/day carbohydrate for at least 2 days
before the studies. Informed written consent was obtained from all
subjects after explanation of the nature, purpose, and potential risks of
these studies. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Temple University Hospital.
Experimental design. All patients were admitted to Temple University
Hospital's General Clinical Research Center 1 day before the studies.
The next morning after an overnight fast, a short polyethylene catheter
was inserted into an antecubital vein for infusion of test substances.
Another catheter was placed into a contralateral forearm vein for blood

sampling. This arm was wrapped with a heating blanket (~70°C) to
arterialize venous blood. C-peptide was then infused to determine
individual C-peptide kinetics. Between 5:00 and 6:00 P.M., the patients ate
a standard dinner consisting of 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 30%
fat. At midnight, glucose was clamped at the patients' prevailing blood
glucose levels (isoglycemic clamp, —11.1 mmol/1) and continued for 72 h
in five patients. In one patient, glucose was clamped for only 36 h. Blood
samples were collected every 2 h for determination of hormones and
substrates. One to two months later, three of the original six patients
and two patients who had not been studied before were admitted to the
General Clinical Research Center for a 24-h glucose turnover (GTO)
study. After an overnight fast, their plasma glucose was clamped at
—11.1 mmol/1, and blood was collected hourly for 24 h for determination
of GTO rates.
Procedures
Hyperglycemic clamps. Six patients (four men and two women) were
studied. A 5% glucose solution was infused at variable rates for 72 h to
produce plasma glucose concentrations of —11.1 mmol/1. Blood samples
were collected eveiy 10-15 min for the initial 4 h of glucose infusion,
every 1 h thereafter for measurement of glucose, and every 2 h for
determination of insulin, C-peptide, cortisol, growth hormone, free fatty
acids (FFAs), and lactate. The patients fasted during the study, but were
allowed to drink water. Bed rest was continued. Lights were turned off
at 9:30 P.M. and turned on at 7:00 A.M. the next morning. Sleep was
polygraphically monitored during one night. Plasma electrolytes, body
weight, and fluid balance were monitored every 6 h. Fluid balance was
maintained with infusion of normal saline. Potassium and magnesium
were added to the glucose infusion as needed to maintain normal plasma
concentrations.
GTO. Five patients (three men and two women) were studied. GTO was
determined with [3-3H]glucose. The tracer infusion (40 |xCi over 1 min
followed by 0.4 |xCi/min) was started 90 min before the initiation of the
measurements to ensure isotopical equilibration. Glucose was isolated
from blood for determination of [3-3H]glucose specific activity as
described (10). [3-3H]glucose specific activity remained stable throughout the 24-h studies. Rates of total body glucose appearance (GRJ and
disappearance (GRd) were calculated using Steele's equation for steadystate conditions (11). GRtl values were corrected for urinary glucose
excretion (0.06 ± 0.007 |xmol • kg"1 • min"1). (GRa - urinary glucose
excretion = GRd.)
Hepatic glucose production (HGP) was calculated as the difference
between the isotopically determined GRa and the rates of glucose
infusion needed to maintain hyperglycemia during the clamps.
C-peptide kinetic studies. An intravenous bolus of 50 nmol of
biosynthetic human C-peptide (Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) was administered
to each subject after an overnight fast, and plasma C-peptide was
measured at frequent intervals for 3 h as described by Van Cauter et al.
(12). Individual C-peptide kinetic parameters were determined by analysis of the C-peptide decay curves. The C-peptide kinetic parameters
were used to calculate the insulin secretory rates (ISRs) for each time
interval between successive blood samples by deconvolution of peripheral C-peptide concentrations (12).
Insulin clearance rates were determined for 6-h periods by dividing
the areas under the ISR curves by the area under the serum insulin
curves.
Sleep recording. Sleep was monitored with a portable computerized
polysomnographic system, (Alice 3, Healthdyne, Marietta, GA). The
polygraphic records were scored visually at 30-s intervals in sleep stages
1, 2, 3, 4, and rapid eye movement (REM) based on the criteria of
Rechtshaffen and Kales (13).
Determination of diurnal rhythms. To identify a rhythmic pattern,
we applied a refined first-order Fourier transform to the respective
curves of glucose infusion rate (GIR), cortisol, and FFAs. In a first step,
data were normalized to their respective mean values. The autocorrelation function A(T) = f (C)(O • C(t + T) dt, where C is the normalized
data points, t is the time, and T is the lag time of the correlation, then
was applied to each set of normalized data. This function eliminates the
background noise and the nonperiodical events in the defined time
interval. The frequency (in cycles per 24 h) and the amplitude in the time
domain (in percentage variation) of the cyclical phenomena, were then
determined using the Fourier transform F(io) - At/ A(T) • cos • (ivT)
dT, where iv is the pulsation frequency and A is the amplitude of the
signal (14).
Analytical procedures. Plasma glucose was measured with a glucose
analyzer (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Serum-free insulin was determined
by radioimmunoassay (RIA) after polyethylene glycol precipitation
using an antiserum with minimal (<0.2%) cross-reactivity with proinsulin (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Human growth hormone (15) and glucagon
(16) were determined by RIA. Cortisol was measured with a kit (Diagnostic, Los Angeles, CA). Plasma FFA concentration was determined
with a kit from Wako (Richmond, VA). Lactate and alanine were
measured enzymatically (17,18).
Statistical analysis. All data are expressed as means ± SE. Statistical
significance was assessed using analysis of variance and Student's
two-tailed I test when indicated.
RESULTS
Glucose, insulin, insulin secretion, clearance, and GIR.
Mean glucose concentration was 11.9 ± 0.4 mmol/1 (215 ± 7
mg/dl) (coefficient of variation [CV] 5.8 ± 0.6%). Mean insulin
concentration was 174 ± 18 pmol/1 (29 ± 3 (xU/ml). Individual serum insulin concentrations were stable throughout the
studies in all six patients (Figs. 1 and 2). Mean ISR was 121 ±
23 pmol/min (0.01815 ± 0.00345 U/min or 0.18 mU-kg"1 •
min"1), and mean insulin clearance was 0.75 ± 0.16 1/min
(7.53 ml • kg"1 • min"1).
GIR reflected total body insulin sensitivity. Visual inspection of Fig. 1 showed a pulsatile rhythm of GIR. Fourier
transform of the GIR data showed a cycle duration of 22.9 ±
1.4 h and a mean amplitude (variation around the mean) of
47.8 ± 11.2% (± 3.8 ixmol • kg"1 • min"1). GIR was lowest in
the morning (8:31 A.M. [±52 min]) and highest in the evening
(7:04 P.M. [±58 min]). The differences between trough and
peak values were statistically significant for all 3 days (P <
0.04, P < 0.01, and P < 0.01, respectively).
Glucose production and utilization. Under steady-state
conditions, GIR is determined by peripheral (muscle) glucose uptake (GRd) and HGP (Fig. 3). The circadian changes
in GIR could have been produced, therefore, either by
changes in GRd, HGP, or a combination of both. To differentiate between these possibilities, we measured GTO at 1-h
intervals between —9:00 A.M. and ~7:00 A.M. the next morning
in five patients (three of whom had previously participated in
the 72-h clamp studies).
Glucose was clamped at 11.6 ± 0.4 mmol/1 (209 ± 7 mg/dl)
(CV 7.4%). Serum insulin was 168 ± 12 pmol/1 (28 ± 2 |xU/ml)
and did not change significantly during the 24-h study period.
GIR exhibited the same circadian changes that were seen
previously during the 72-h clamp studies, rising from 0 to
6.1 ± 1.1 ixmol • kg"1 • min"1 (1.1 ± 0.2 mg • kg"1 • min"1) at
—7:00 P.M. and decreasing thereafter to reach a nadir of 1.2 ±
0.6 jxmol-kg^-min"1 (0.2 ± 0.1 mg-kg"1 • min"1) -12 h
later. HGP closely mirrored the changes in GIR, whereas GRd
did not change significantly. Plasma FFA and cortisol levels
paralleled HGP values, although the HGP nadir seemed to
precede the cortisol nadir by several hours.
FFA, cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon, lactate, and
alanine concentrations. Plasma FFA and cortisol concentrations changed with circadian rhythmicity with cycle duraDIABETES, VOL. 45, AUGUST 1996

DISCUSSION
Absence of circadian rhythmicity of insulin secretion in
NIDDM. We have recently reported that insulin secretion
rates and serum insulin levels change with a circadian
rhythm in nondiabetic subjects during hyperglycemic clamping (9). The absence of this rhythmicity is a newly described
defect in patients with NIDDM. Absence of rhythmic insulin

changes allowed us to study insulin sensitivity at constant
blood glucose and insulin levels.
Presence of circadian rhythmicity of insulin sensitivity
in NIDDM. Diurnal rhythmicity of insulin sensitivity and
glucose tolerance in diabetic patients, although long suspected (1-5), has been difficult to demonstrate mainly because of the strong interdependence of changes in glucose
and insulin and other confounding factors including feeding,
exercise, and changes in insulin clearance (1). In the present
study, the patients were kept on bed rest, they did not eat,
and their blood glucose and insulin levels, and insulin
secretion and clearance rates all remained unchanged during
the entire 72-h study. GIR, reflecting total body insulin
sensitivity, rose daily from a nadir in the morning (~8:00
a.m.) to a peak in the evening (—7:00 P.M.). The cycle
duration (from peak to peak) was —24 h hence; these cycles
were by definition circadian. The cycle amplitude (from
trough to peak) was —7.8 ixmol • kg"1 • min"1 (1.4 mg • kg"1 •

min J). To our knowledge, this is the first unequivocal
demonstration of circadian rhythmicity in insulin sensitivity
in patients with NIDDM. Similar results have been obtained
in normal volunteers in whom glucose was infused at constant rates. In these studies, glucose and insulin levels
changed together, which complicated quantitation of cyclic
changes in insulin sensitivity (19,20).
Sleep did not appear to affect the cyclic changes in insulin
sensitivity because the directional changes (from increase to
decrease and vice versa) occurred before and after the sleep
period. Moreover, insulin sensitivity (GIR) was the same
whether the patients were asleep or awake (4.7 ± 0.9 vs.
4.7 ± 0.6 fimol • kg"1 • min"1). Sleep, however, was frequently interrupted; therefore, our data do not rule out the
possibility that uninterrupted sleep may have a modulating effect on the circadian rhythmicity of insulin sensitivity as was reported by Van Cauter et al. in normal subjects
(21).
What caused the circadian rhythmicity of insulin sensitivity? Changes in GIR could have reflected changes in
peripheral (muscle) insulin sensitivity (i.e., in GRd), changes
in hepatic insulin sensitivity (i.e., in HGP), or both. To
differentiate between these possibilities, we determined GRd
and HGP in five patients at hourly intervals for 22 h. Glucose
was again clamped at —11.6 mmol/1, and serum insulin levels
remained stable. The results indicated unequivocally that the
nocturnal decrease in GIR was caused by an increase in HGP
with little or no change in peripheral glucose uptake. These
results are compatible with a large body of evidence showing
elevated rates of HGP in patients with NIDDM after an
overnight fast (22) and with the demonstration that plasma
glucose levels and HGP rates rise in the early morning hours
(dawn phenomenon) (8,23). Our data suggested, however,
that the dawn phenomenon may be explained, at least in
part, by the circadian HGP cycle, where HGP starts to rise in

the evening, reaches a peak in the early morning hours, and
then declines. Superimposed on this circadian rhythm may
be the effects of sleep on HGP, because Clore et al. (24) have
shown in normal subjects that sleep decreased and arousal
from sleep increased HGP.
What caused the circadian HGP changes? Plasma FFA
concentrations showed circadian fluctuations and correlated
inversely (r = -0.72, P < 0.001) with GIR (and presumably
with HGP). Similar close relationships between plasma FFA
and HGP have recently been demonstrated in normal volunteers (24) and in dogs (25). These studies suggested that
FFAs stimulated HGP, probably by changing hepatic insulin
sensitivity. While this concept has been well supported by
many in vitro studies (26), the in vivo evidence remains
controversial. Elevation of plasma FFA concentrations has
been shown to increase HGP only when fatty acid-mediated
stimulation of insulin secretion was prevented (27). In addition, several studies have shown that acute elevation of
plasma FFAs resulted in the inhibition of insulin-induced
suppression of HGP (28,29). It was not clear, however,
whether this effect was produced by elevated FFA levels or
by the glycerol that was present in the commercial triglyceride emulsions infused in these studies (29). The present
study was not complicated by either of these confounders.
The results thus support the notion that FFAs can produce
hepatic as well as peripheral insulin resistance (29,30). In
this respect, it needs to be emphasized that FFAs have been
shown to inhibit only insulin-stimulated glucose uptake but
not basal glucose uptake (29). The present study was performed under isoglycemic, i.e., basal conditions; hence, FFA
did not inhibit glucose uptake.
Plasma cortisol, which is known to fluctuate in circadian
cycles, also correlated negatively with GIR (r = -0.64, P <
0.001). In patients with IDDM, physiological elevations in
plasma cortisol have been shown to markedly increase HGP
(31) and, to a lesser degree, to cause peripheral insulin
resistance (32,33). Recent studies in adrenalectomized rats
indicated that glucocorticoids played a key role in the fatty
acid-induced stimulation of gluconeogenesis (34). This and
data from normal human subjects showing that isolated
cortisol deficiency reduced plasma FFA concentrations by
~50% raised the interesting possibility that circadian cortisol
secretion may have been, at least partly, responsible for the
circadian FFA rhythmicity (35). Clearly, however, our results
did not establish a cause and effect relationship between
FFAs, cortisol, and HGP. In fact, analysis of individual
relationships showed that in three of the five patients,
plasma cortisol and HGP changed in synchrony, while in two
patients cortisol started to rise several hours after HGP.
These findings do not support the notion that cortisol was
primarily responsible for the rhythmic changes in HGP,
because it has been shown that the cortisol effects on HGP
required several hours to develop (31,33).
Growth hormone levels increased at the onset of sleep.
There was, however, no circadian pattern nor did growth
hormone levels correlate with GIR. Nevertheless, some
growth hormone bursts may have been missed because of
the 2-h blood sampling, and the evening growth peaks may
have contributed to the nocturnal rise in HGP. Plasma
glucagon concentrations did not change significantly. Epinephrine, which is known to have a circadian rhythm of
secretion (36), was not measured. The amplitude of the
circadian epinephrine changes, however, are known to be
G. BODEN, X. CHEN, AND J.L URBAIN
too small to affect HGP directly (32,37), but they may be able
to affect lipolysis and thus plasma FFA concentrations.
Clinical significance. The circadian rhythmicity of insulin
sensitivity in patients with NIDDM, described here, predicts
that glucose tolerance will be worse in the early morning
than at any other time. This helps to explain why insulin
requirements in diabetic patients are highest in the morning.
It also provides a rationale for the effectiveness of the
twice-a-day regimen, which consists of bedtime insulin and
daytime sulfonylurea administration, the bedtime insulin
acting to prevent the nocturnal rise in HGP. Lastly, our data
suggested that suppression of the nocturnal FFA and/or
cortisol peaks may offer a new approach to the control of
fasting blood glucose levels in patients with NIDDM.
