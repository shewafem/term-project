It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to	
supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. IDSA considers adherence to these	
guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light	
of each patient’s individual circumstances.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY	
Background	
Invasive infection due to Candida species is largely a condition associated with medical progress, and is widely recognized as a major	
cause of morbidity and mortality in the healthcare environment.	
There are at least 15 distinct Candida species that cause human disease, but >90% of invasive disease is caused by the 5 most common	
pathogens, C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis,	
and C. krusei. Each of these organisms has unique virulence potential, antifungal susceptibility, and epidemiology, but taken as	
a whole, signiﬁcant infections due to these organisms are generally referred to as invasive candidiasis. Mucosal Candida	
infections—especially those involving the oropharynx, esophagus, and vagina—are not considered to be classically invasive	
disease, but they are included in these guidelines. Since the	
last iteration of these guidelines in 2009 [1], there have been	
new data pertaining to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment	
for proven or suspected invasive candidiasis, leading to signiﬁcant modiﬁcations in our treatment recommendations.	
Summarized below are the 2016 revised recommendations	
for the management of candidiasis. Due to the guideline’s relevance to pediatrics, the guideline has been reviewed and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and	
the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS). The Mycoses	
Study Group (MSG) has also endorsed these guidelines. The	
panel followed a guideline development process that has been	
adopted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America	
(IDSA), which includes a systematic method of grading both	
the quality of evidence (very low, low, moderate, and high)	
and the strength of the recommendation (weak or strong) [2]	
(Figure 1). [3] The guidelines are not intended to replace clinical judgment in the management of individual patients. A detailed description of the methods, background, and evidence	
summaries that support each recommendation can be found	
in the full text of the guideline.	
I. What Is the Treatment for Candidemia in Nonneutropenic Patients?	
Recommendations	
1. An echinocandin (caspofungin: loading dose 70 mg, then	
50 mg daily; micafungin: 100 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading dose 200 mg, then 100 mg daily) is recommended as initial therapy (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
2. Fluconazole, intravenous or oral, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily is an acceptable alternative to an echinocandin as initial therapy in selected	
patients, including those who are not critically ill and who	
are considered unlikely to have a ﬂuconazole-resistant Candida species (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
3. Testing for azole susceptibility is recommended for all bloodstream and other clinically relevant Candida isolates. Testing	
for echinocandin susceptibility should be considered in patients who have had prior treatment with an echinocandin	
and among those who have infection with C. glabrata or	
C. parapsilosis (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

4. Transition from an echinocandin to ﬂuconazole (usually	
within 5–7 days) is recommended for patients who are clinically stable, have isolates that are susceptible to ﬂuconazole	
(eg, C. albicans), and have negative repeat blood cultures following initiation of antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
5. For infection due to C. glabrata, transition to higher-dose	
ﬂuconazole 800 mg (12 mg/kg) daily or voriconazole 200–	
300 (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily should only be considered	
among patients with ﬂuconazole-susceptible or voriconazole-susceptible isolates (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
6. Lipid formulation amphotericin B (AmB) (3–5 mg/kg daily)	
is a reasonable alternative if there is intolerance, limited	
availability, or resistance to other antifungal agents (strong	
recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
7. Transition from AmB to ﬂuconazole is recommended after	
5–7 days among patients who have isolates that are susceptible to ﬂuconazole, who are clinically stable, and in whom	
repeat cultures on antifungal therapy are negative (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
8. Among patients with suspected azole- and echinocandinresistant Candida infections, lipid formulation AmB (3–5	
mg/kg daily) is recommended (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
9. Voriconazole 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses, then	
200 mg (3 mg/kg) twice daily is effective for candidemia, but	
offers little advantage over ﬂuconazole as initial therapy	
(strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Voriconazole is recommended as step-down oral therapy for selected	
cases of candidemia due to C. krusei (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
10. All nonneutropenic patients with candidemia should have	
a dilated ophthalmological examination, preferably performed by an ophthalmologist, within the ﬁrst week after	
diagnosis (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
11. Follow-up blood cultures should be performed every day	
or every other day to establish the time point at which

candidemia has been cleared (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
12. Recommended duration of therapy for candidemia without	
obvious metastatic complications is for 2 weeks after documented clearance of Candida species from the bloodstream	
and resolution of symptoms attributable to candidemia	
(strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
II. Should Central Venous Catheters Be Removed in Nonneutropenic	
Patients With Candidemia?	
Recommendation	
13. Central venous catheters (CVCs) should be removed as	
early as possible in the course of candidemia when the source	
is presumed to be the CVC and the catheter can be removed	
safely; this decision should be individualized for each patient	
(strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
III. What Is the Treatment for Candidemia in Neutropenic Patients?	
Recommendations	
14. An echinocandin (caspofungin: loading dose 70 mg, then	
50 mg daily; micafungin: 100 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading	
dose 200 mg, then 100 mg daily) is recommended as initial	
therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
15. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, is an effective	
but less attractive alternative because of the potential for	
toxicity (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
16. Fluconazole, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400	
mg (6 mg/kg) daily, is an alternative for patients who are	
not critically ill and have had no prior azole exposure	
(weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
17. Fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, can be used for stepdown therapy during persistent neutropenia in clinically stable patients who have susceptible isolates and documented	
bloodstream clearance (weak recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
18. Voriconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses,	
then 200–300 mg (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily, can be used in situations in which additional mold coverage is desired (weak	
recommendation; low-quality evidence). Voriconazole can	
also be used as step-down therapy during neutropenia in	
clinically stable patients who have had documented bloodstream clearance and isolates that are susceptible to voriconazole (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
19. For infections due to C. krusei, an echinocandin, lipid	
formulation AmB, or voriconazole is recommended (strong	
recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
20. Recommended minimum duration of therapy for candidemia without metastatic complications is 2 weeks after	
documented clearance of Candida from the bloodstream,	
provided neutropenia and symptoms attributable to candidemia have resolved (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
21. Ophthalmological ﬁndings of choroidal and vitreal infection are minimal until recovery from neutropenia; therefore,	
dilated funduscopic examinations should be performed within the ﬁrst week after recovery from neutropenia (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
22. In the neutropenic patient, sources of candidiasis other	
than a CVC (eg, gastrointestinal tract) predominate. Catheter	
removal should be considered on an individual basis (strong	
recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
23. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–mobilized	
granulocyte transfusions can be considered in cases of persistent candidemia with anticipated protracted neutropenia	
(weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
IV. What Is the Treatment for Chronic Disseminated (Hepatosplenic)	
Candidiasis?	
Recommendations	
24. Initial therapy with lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily	
OR an echinocandin (micafungin: 100 mg daily; caspofungin:	
70-mg loading dose, then 50 mg daily; or anidulafungin: 200mg loading dose, then 100 mg daily), for several weeks is recommended, followed by oral ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg)	
daily, for patients who are unlikely to have a ﬂuconazoleresistant isolate (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
25. Therapy should continue until lesions resolve on repeat	
imaging, which is usually several months. Premature discontinuation of antifungal therapy can lead to relapse (strong	
recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
26. If chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation is	
required, it should not be delayed because of the presence of	
chronic disseminated candidiasis, and antifungal therapy	
should be continued throughout the period of high risk to prevent relapse (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
27. For patients who have debilitating persistent fevers,	
short-term (1–2 weeks) treatment with nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs or corticosteroids can be considered	
(weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
V. What Is the Role of Empiric Treatment for Suspected Invasive	
Candidiasis in Nonneutropenic Patients in the Intensive Care Unit?	
Recommendations	
28. Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered in critically	
ill patients with risk factors for invasive candidiasis and no	
other known cause of fever and should be based on clinical	
assessment of risk factors, surrogate markers for invasive candidiasis, and/or culture data from nonsterile sites (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Empiric antifungal	
therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients who	
have the above risk factors and who have clinical signs of septic shock (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
29. Preferred empiric therapy for suspected candidiasis in	
nonneutropenic patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is

an echinocandin (caspofungin: loading dose of 70 mg, then	
50 mg daily; micafungin: 100 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading dose of 200 mg, then 100 mg daily) (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
30. Fluconazole, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400	
mg (6 mg/kg) daily, is an acceptable alternative for patients	
who have had no recent azole exposure and are not colonized	
with azole-resistant Candida species (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
31. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, is an alternative	
if there is intolerance to other antifungal agents (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
32. Recommended duration of empiric therapy for suspected	
invasive candidiasis in those patients who improve is 2	
weeks, the same as for treatment of documented candidemia	
(weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
33. For patients who have no clinical response to empiric antifungal therapy at 4–5 days and who do not have subsequent	
evidence of invasive candidiasis after the start of empiric	
therapy or have a negative non-culture-based diagnostic	
assay with a high negative predictive value, consideration	
should be given to stopping antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
VI. Should Prophylaxis Be Used to Prevent Invasive Candidiasis in the	
Intensive Care Unit Setting?	
Recommendations	
34. Fluconazole, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400	
mg (6 mg/kg) daily, could be used in high-risk patients in	
adult ICUs with a high rate (>5%) of invasive candidiasis	
(weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
35. An alternative is to give an echinocandin (caspofungin:	
70-mg loading dose, then 50 mg daily; anidulafungin:	
200-mg loading dose and then 100 mg daily; or micafungin: 100 mg daily) (weak recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
36. Daily bathing of ICU patients with chlorhexidine, which	
has been shown to decrease the incidence of bloodstream infections including candidemia, could be considered (weak	
recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
VII. What Is the Treatment for Neonatal Candidiasis, Including Central	
Nervous System Infection?	
What Is the Treatment for Invasive Candidiasis and Candidemia?	
Recommendations	
37. AmB deoxycholate, 1 mg/kg daily, is recommended for	
neonates with disseminated candidiasis (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
38. Fluconazole, 12 mg/kg intravenous or oral daily, is a reasonable alternative in patients who have not been on ﬂuconazole prophylaxis (strong recommendation; moderate-quality	
evidence).	
39. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, is an alternative,	
but should be used with caution, particularly in the presence	
of urinary tract involvement (weak recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
40. Echinocandins should be used with caution and generally	
limited to salvage therapy or to situations in which resistance	
or toxicity preclude the use of AmB deoxycholate or ﬂuconazole (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
41. A lumbar puncture and a dilated retinal examination are	
recommended in neonates with cultures positive for Candida	
species from blood and/or urine (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
42. Computed tomographic or ultrasound imaging of the genitourinary tract, liver, and spleen should be performed	
if blood cultures are persistently positive for Candida species	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
43. CVC removal is strongly recommended (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
44. The recommended duration of therapy for candidemia	
without obvious metastatic complications is for 2 weeks	
after documented clearance of Candida species from the	
bloodstream and resolution of signs attributable to candidemia (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
What Is the Treatment for Central Nervous System Infections in	
Neonates?	
Recommendations	
45. For initial treatment, AmB deoxycholate, 1 mg/kg intravenous daily, is recommended (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
46. An alternative regimen is liposomal AmB, 5 mg/kg daily	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
47. The addition of ﬂucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily, may be	
considered as salvage therapy in patients who have not had a	
clinical response to initial AmB therapy, but adverse effects	
are frequent (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
48. For step-down treatment after the patient has responded to	
initial treatment, ﬂuconazole, 12 mg/kg daily, is recommended for isolates that are susceptible to ﬂuconazole (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
49. Therapy should continue until all signs, symptoms, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and radiological abnormalities, if present,	
have resolved (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
50. Infected central nervous system (CNS) devices, including	
ventriculostomy drains and shunts, should be removed if at	
all possible (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
What Are the Recommendations for Prophylaxis in the Neonatal	
Intensive Care Unit Setting?	
Recommendations	
51. In nurseries with high rates (>10%) of invasive candidiasis,	
intravenous or oral ﬂuconazole prophylaxis, 3–6 mg/kg twice

on 11 August 2018	
weekly for 6 weeks, in neonates with birth weights <1000 g is	
recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
52. Oral nystatin, 100 000 units 3 times daily for 6 weeks, is an	
alternative to ﬂuconazole in neonates with birth weights	
<1500 g in situations in which availability or resistance	
preclude the use of ﬂuconazole (weak recommendation;	
moderate-quality evidence).	
53. Oral bovine lactoferrin (100 mg/day) may be effective in	
neonates <1500 g but is not currently available in US hospitals (weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
VIII. What Is the Treatment for Intra-abdominal Candidiasis?	
Recommendations	
54. Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection	
and signiﬁcant risk factors for candidiasis, including recent	
abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
55. Treatment of intra-abdominal candidiasis should include	
source control, with appropriate drainage and/or debridement (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
56. The choice of antifungal therapy is the same as for the	
treatment of candidemia or empiric therapy for nonneutropenic patients in the ICU (See sections I and V) (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
57. The duration of therapy should be determined by adequacy	
of source control and clinical response (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
IX. Does the Isolation of Candida Species From the Respiratory Tract	
Require Antifungal Therapy?	
Recommendation	
58. Growth of Candida from respiratory secretions usually indicates colonization and rarely requires treatment with antifungal	
therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
X. What Is the Treatment for Candida Intravascular Infections, Including	
Endocarditis and Infections of Implantable Cardiac Devices?	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Endocarditis?	
Recommendations	
59. For native valve endocarditis, lipid formulation AmB, 3–5	
mg/kg daily, with or without ﬂucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times	
daily, OR high-dose echinocandin (caspofungin 150 mg	
daily, micafungin 150 mg daily, or anidulafungin 200 mg	
daily) is recommended for initial therapy (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
60. Step-down therapy to ﬂuconazole, 400–800 mg (6–12 mg/	
kg) daily, is recommended for patients who have susceptible	
Candida isolates, have demonstrated clinical stability, and	
have cleared Candida from the bloodstream (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
61. Oral voriconazole, 200–300 mg (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily, or	
posaconazole tablets, 300 mg daily, can be used as step-down	
therapy for isolates that are susceptible to those agents but	
not susceptible to ﬂuconazole (weak recommendation; very	
low-quality evidence).	
62. Valve replacement is recommended; treatment should continue for at least 6 weeks after surgery and for a longer duration	
in patients with perivalvular abscesses and other complications	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
63. For patients who cannot undergo valve replacement, longterm suppression with ﬂuconazole, 400–800 mg (6–12 mg/	
kg) daily, if the isolate is susceptible, is recommended (strong	
recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
64. For prosthetic valve endocarditis, the same antifungal regimens suggested for native valve endocarditis are recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Chronic suppressive antifungal therapy with ﬂuconazole,	
400–800 mg (6–12 mg/kg) daily, is recommended to prevent recurrence (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Infection of Implantable	
Cardiac Devices?	
Recommendations	
65. For pacemaker and implantable cardiac deﬁbrillator infections, the entire device should be removed (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
66. Antifungal therapy is the same as that recommended for	
native valve endocarditis (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
67. For infections limited to generator pockets, 4 weeks of antifungal therapy after removal of the device is recommended	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
68. For infections involving the wires, at least 6 weeks of antifungal therapy after wire removal is recommended (strong	
recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
69. For ventricular assist devices that cannot be removed, the antifungal regimen is the same as that recommended for native	
valve endocarditis (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Chronic suppressive therapy with ﬂuconazole if the isolate is susceptible, for as long as the device remains in place is	
recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Suppurative Thrombophlebitis?	
Recommendations	
70. Catheter removal and incision and drainage or resection of	
the vein, if feasible, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
71. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, OR ﬂuconazole,	
400–800 mg (6–12 mg/kg) daily, OR an echinocandin (caspofungin 150 mg daily, micafungin 150 mg daily, or anidulafungin 200 mg daily) for at least 2 weeks after candidemia

(if present) has cleared is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
72. Step-down therapy to ﬂuconazole, 400–800 mg (6–12 mg/	
kg) daily, should be considered for patients who have initially	
responded to AmB or an echinocandin, are clinically stable,	
and have a ﬂuconazole-susceptible isolate (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
73. Resolution of the thrombus can be used as evidence to discontinue antifungal therapy if clinical and culture data are	
supportive (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
XI. What Is the Treatment for Candida Osteoarticular Infections?	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Osteomyelitis?	
Recommendations	
74. Fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for 6–12 months OR	
an echinocandin (caspofungin 50–70 mg daily, micafungin	
100 mg daily, or anidulafungin 100 mg daily) for at least 2	
weeks followed by ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for	
6–12 months is recommended (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
75. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, for at least 2	
weeks followed by ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for	
6–12 months is a less attractive alternative (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
76. Surgical debridement is recommended in selected cases	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Septic Arthritis?	
77. Fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for 6 weeks OR an	
echinocandin (caspofungin 50–70 mg daily, micafungin 100	
mg daily, or anidulafungin 100 mg daily) for 2 weeks followed	
by ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for at least 4 weeks is

78. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, for 2 weeks, followed by ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for at least 4	
weeks is a less attractive alternative (weak recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
79. Surgical drainage is indicated in all cases of septic arthritis	
(strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
80. For septic arthritis involving a prosthetic device, device removal is recommended (strong recommendation; moderatequality evidence).	
81. If the prosthetic device cannot be removed, chronic suppression with ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, if the isolate is susceptible, is recommended (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
XII. What Is the Treatment for Candida Endophthalmitis?	
What Is the General Approach to Candida Endophthalmitis?	
Recommendations	
82. All patients with candidemia should have a dilated retinal	
examination, preferably performed by an ophthalmologist,	
within the ﬁrst week of therapy in nonneutropenic patients	
to establish if endophthalmitis is present (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For neutropenic patients, it is	
recommended to delay the examination until neutrophil recovery (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
83. The extent of ocular infection (chorioretinitis with or without macular involvement and with or without vitritis) should	
be determined by an ophthalmologist (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
84. Decisions regarding antifungal treatment and surgical intervention should be made jointly by an ophthalmologist and	
an infectious diseases physician (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Chorioretinitis Without	
Vitritis?	
Recommendations	
85. For ﬂuconazole-/voriconazole-susceptible isolates, ﬂuconazole, loading dose, 800 mg (12 mg/kg), then 400–800	
mg (6–12 mg/kg) daily OR voriconazole, loading dose 400	
mg (6 mg/kg) intravenous twice daily for 2 doses, then	
300 mg (4 mg/kg) intravenous or oral twice daily is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
86. For ﬂuconazole-/voriconazole-resistant isolates, liposomal	
AmB, 3–5 mg/kg intravenous daily, with or without oral ﬂucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
87. With macular involvement, antifungal agents as noted	
above PLUS intravitreal injection of either AmB deoxycholate, 5–10 µg/0.1 mL sterile water, or voriconazole, 100 µg/	
0.1 mL sterile water or normal saline, to ensure a prompt	
high level of antifungal activity is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
88. The duration of treatment should be at least 4–6 weeks,	
with the ﬁnal duration depending on resolution of the lesions	
as determined by repeated ophthalmological examinations	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Chorioretinitis With Vitritis?	
Recommendations	
89. Antifungal therapy as detailed above for chorioretinitis	
without vitritis, PLUS intravitreal injection of either amphotericin B deoxycholate, 5–10 µg/0.1 mL sterile water, or	
voriconazole, 100 µg/0.1 mL sterile water or normal saline	
is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
90. Vitrectomy should be considered to decrease the burden of	
organisms and to allow the removal of fungal abscesses that	
are inaccessible to systemic antifungal agents (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
91. The duration of treatment should be at least 4–6 weeks,

Infections due to Candida species are major causes of morbidity and mortality in humans, causing a diverse spectrum of	
clinical disease ranging from superﬁcial and mucosal infections	
to invasive disease associated with candidemia and metastatic	
organ involvement. As an entity, candidemia is one of the	
most common healthcare-associated bloodstream infections in	
US hospitals, typically ranking as the third or fourth most	
common cause of healthcare–associated bloodstream infection.	
A recent multicenter point-prevalence survey identiﬁed Candida species as the most commonly isolated healthcare-associated	
bloodstream pathogen [4]. Among patients with candidemia	
and other forms of invasive candidiasis, non-albicans Candida	
species constitute approximately 50% of all relevant isolates,	
representing a steady trend in many regions throughout the	
world for more than a decade [5–12].	
Among the many clinical manifestations of candidiasis, candidemia and invasive candidiasis have been given the most	
attention in clinical trials. Candidemia is associated with up	
to 47% attributable mortality [5–13], and this is even higher	
among persons with septic shock [14]. Several authors have	
demonstrated that mortality is closely linked to both timing	
of therapy and/or source control [14–19]. That is, earlier intervention with appropriate antifungal therapy and removal of a	
contaminated central venous catheter (CVC) or drainage of infected material is generally associated with better overall outcomes [14–19]. CVCs are commonly linked with candidemia,	
but catheters are not always the source, especially among	
neutropenic patients in whom the gastrointestinal tract is a	
common source. Most experts agree that thoughtful patientspeciﬁc management of CVCs is critical in the overall management of the infection [19].	
The continued reliance on blood cultures, which are notoriously insensitive as markers of disease, remains a signiﬁcant obstacle to early intervention for this condition. The development	
of reliable nonculture assays is critical to providing the opportunity for earlier intervention and more targeted antifungal	
therapy among large numbers of patients in whom traditional	
blood cultures are insensitive or provide untimely results [20].	
Species distribution is also a signiﬁcant challenge for all	
forms of candidiasis, and there is considerable geographic, center-to-center, and even unit-to-unit variability in the prevalence	
of pathogenic Candida species [8–12].Indeed, candidiasis is not	
one but rather several diseases, with each Candida species presenting its own unique characteristics with respect to tissue tropism, propensity to cause invasive disease, virulence, and	
antifungal susceptibility. A working knowledge of the local epidemiology and rates of antifungal resistance is critical in making informed therapeutic decisions while awaiting culture and	
susceptibility data.	
Despite the overall robust nature of the randomized controlled trials examining treatment of candidemia and other	
forms of invasive candidiasis [21–34], no single trial has demonstrated clear superiority of one therapeutic agent over another. Careful analysis of these clinical data sometimes leads to	
conﬂicting conclusions. For instance, the use of amphotericin	
B (AmB) plus ﬂuconazole is as least as effective as higherdose (800 mg daily) ﬂuconazole given alone for patients with	
candidemia [22], but there is little role for this combination	
in current practice, especially as echinocandins are such a safe

on 11 August 2018	
and effective alternative. Similarly, voriconazole is as effective as	
the strategy of sequential AmB and ﬂuconazole for candidemia,	
but few would choose voriconazole in this setting as there is little advantage and potentially greater toxicity associated with	
using this agent compared to other therapies [23].	
The echinocandins have emerged as preferred agents for	
most episodes of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, with	
the exception of central nervous system (CNS), eye, and urinary	
tract infections due to these organisms. This preference is based	
on a strong safety proﬁle, convenience, early fungicidal activity,	
a trend toward better outcomes based on data from individual	
studies and combined analyses of candidemia studies [19, 25],	
and the emergence of azole-resistant Candida species. The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida species further	
complicates the selection of antifungal therapy for the immediate future [10, 12, 35–38] as there are no good prospective data	
to guide therapy.	
There is an abundance of clinical data generated from large	
randomized clinical trials for candidemia, Candida esophagitis,	
oropharyngeal candidiasis, and prophylaxis studies in special	
populations, such as patients in intensive care units (ICUs), neonates, and selected transplant recipients, and these studies	
have led to important insights into optimal therapeutic approaches in these vulnerable populations. For those with less	
common manifestations of disease, such as osteomyelitis,	
endophthalmitis, and infective endocarditis, treatment recommendations are largely based on extrapolation from randomized studies of patients with other forms of disease, small	
retrospective series, and anecdotal reports. Thus, there is a critical need to assess these data in an ongoing manner to provide	
timely recommendations pertaining to the management of patients with these less common forms of candidiasis.	
METHODS	
Panel Composition	
The most recent version of the Infectious Diseases Society of	
America (IDSA) guideline on the management of patients with	
candidiasis was published in 2009 [1]. For this update, the IDSA	
Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee (SPGC) convened a multidisciplinary panel of 12 experts in the management of patients with candidiasis. The panel consisted of 12	
members of IDSA, and included 11 adult infectious diseases	
physicians and 1 pediatric infectious diseases physician. All	
panel members were selected on the basis of their expertise in	
clinical and/or laboratory mycology with a focus on candidiasis.	
Literature Review and Analysis	
Panel members were each assigned to review the recent literature for at least 1 topic, evaluate the evidence, determine the	
strength of recommendations, and develop written evidence	
in support of these recommendations. PubMed, which includes	
Medline (1946 to present), was searched to identify relevant	
studies for the Candida guideline PICO (population/patient, intervention/indicator, comparator/control, outcome) questions.	
Search strategies were developed and built by 2 independent	
health sciences librarians from the Health Sciences Library System, University of Pittsburgh. For each PICO question, the librarians developed the search strategies using PubMed’s	
command language and appropriate search ﬁelds. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords were used for the	
main search concepts of each PICO question. Articles in all languages and all publication years were included. Initial searches	
were created and conﬁrmed with input from the guideline committee chairs and group leaders from August to November	
2013. The searches were ﬁnalized and delivered between late	
November 2013 and January 2014. After the literature searches	
were performed, authors continued to review the literature and	
added relevant articles as needed.	
Process Overview	
The panel met face-to-face twice and conducted a series of conference calls over a 2-year period. The panel reviewed and discussed all recommendations, their strength, and the quality of	
evidence. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved, and all	
ﬁnal recommendations represent a consensus opinion of the entire panel. For the ﬁnal version of these guidelines, the panel as a	
group reviewed all individual sections.	
Evidence Review: The GRADE Method	
GRADE is a systematic approach to guideline development that	
has been described in detail elsewhere [2, 39]. The IDSA adopted GRADE in 2008. In the GRADE system, the guideline panel	
assigns each recommendation with separate ratings for the underlying quality of evidence supporting the recommendation	
and for the strength with which the recommendation is made	
(Figure 1). Data from randomized controlled trials begin as	
“high” quality, and data from observational studies begin as	
“low” quality. However, the panel may judge that speciﬁc features of the data warrant decreasing or increasing the quality	
of evidence rating, and GRADE provides guidance on how	
such factors should be weighed [39]. The strength assigned to	
a recommendation chieﬂy reﬂects the panel’s conﬁdence that	
the beneﬁts of following the recommendation are likely to outweigh potential harms. While the quality of evidence is an important factor in choosing recommendation strength, it is not	
prescriptive.	
Guidelines and Conﬂicts of Interest	
The expert panel complied with the IDSA policy on conﬂicts of	
interest, which requires disclosure of any ﬁnancial or other interest that may be construed as constituting an actual, potential, or	
apparent conﬂict. Panel members were provided IDSA’s conﬂicts	
of interest disclosure statement and were asked to identify ties to	
companies developing products that may be affected by promulgation of the guideline. Information was requested regarding employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, research

on 11 August 2018	
funding, expert testimony, and membership on company advisory committees. Decisions were made on a case-by-case basis	
as to whether an individual’s role should be limited as a result	
of a conﬂict. Potential conﬂicts of interests are listed in the	
Acknowledgments section.	
Consensus Development Based on Evidence	
The panel obtained feedback from 3 external peer reviewers.	
The guidelines were reviewed and endorsed by the MSG, the	
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS). The guideline was reviewed	
and approved by the IDSA SPGC and the IDSA Board of Directors prior to dissemination.	
Revision Dates	
At annual intervals, the panel chairs will be asked for their input	
on the need to update the guideline based on an examination of	
the current literature. The IDSA SPGC will consider this input	
and determine the necessity and timing of an update. If warranted, the entire panel or a subset thereof will be convened	
to discuss potential changes.	
BACKGROUND	
Antifungal Agents	
Pharmacologic Considerations for Therapy for Candidiasis	
Systemic antifungal agents shown to be effective for the treatment of invasive candidiasis comprise 4 major categories: the	
polyenes (amphotericin B [AmB] deoxycholate, liposomal	
AmB, AmB lipid complex [ABLC], and amphotericin B colloidal dispersion [ABCD, not available in the United States]), the	
triazoles (ﬂuconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole), the echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and	
micafungin), and ﬂucytosine. Data from a recently completed	
clinical trial comparing isavuconazole to an echinocandin for	
treatment of invasive candidiasis are unavailable at this time.	
Clinicians should become familiar with strategies to optimize	
efﬁcacy through an understanding of relevant pharmacokinetic	
properties.	
Amphotericin B	
Most experience with AmB is with the deoxycholate preparation. Three lipid formulations of AmB have been developed	
and approved for use in humans: ABLC, ABCD, and liposomal	
AmB. These agents possess the same spectrum of activity as	
AmB deoxycholate, but daily dosing regimens and toxicity proﬁles differ for each agent. The 3 lipid formulation AmB agents	
have different pharmacological properties and rates of treatment-related adverse events and should not be interchanged	
without careful consideration. In this document, a reference	
to AmB, without a speciﬁc dose or other discussion of form,	
should be taken to be a reference to the general use of any of	
the AmB preparations. For most forms of invasive candidiasis,	
the typical intravenous dosage for AmB deoxycholate is 0.5–0.7	
mg/kg daily, but dosages as high as 1 mg/kg daily should be	
considered for invasive Candida infections caused by less susceptible species, such as C. glabrata and C. krusei. The typical	
dosage for lipid formulation AmB is 3–5 mg/kg daily when used	
for invasive candidiasis. Nephrotoxicity is the most common serious adverse effect associated with AmB deoxycholate therapy,	
resulting in acute kidney injury in up to 50% of recipients and	
an electrolyte-wasting tubular acidosis in a majority of patients	
[40, 41]. Lipid formulations of AmB are more expensive than	
AmB deoxycholate, but all have considerably less nephrotoxicity [42, 43]. Most observers agree that lipid formulations, with	
the exception of ABCD, have fewer infusion-related reactions	
than AmB deoxycholate. The impact of the pharmacokinetics	
and differences in toxicity of lipid formulations of AmB have	
not been formally examined in clinical trials. We are not	
aware of any forms of candidiasis for which lipid formulations	
of AmB are superior to AmB deoxycholate in terms of clinical	
efﬁcacy. In addition, we are not aware of any situation in which	
lipid formulations should not be used, with the exception of urinary tract infections, because of reduced renal excretion of these	
formulations. Animal model studies suggest a pharmacokinetic	
and therapeutic advantage for liposomal AmB in the CNS [44].	
Data demonstrating that AmB deoxycholate–induced nephrotoxicity is associated with a 6.6-fold increase in mortality have	
led many clinicians to use lipid formulations of AmB in proven	
or suspected candidiasis, especially among patients in a highrisk environment, such as an ICU [45].	
Triazoles	
Fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and a	
new expanded-spectrum triazole, isavuconazole, demonstrate	
similar activity against most Candida species [46–51]. Each of	
the azoles has less activity against C. glabrata and C. krusei	
than against other Candida species. All of the azole antifungals	
inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes to some degree [52]. Thus,	
clinicians must carefully consider the inﬂuence on a patient’s	
drug regimen when adding or removing an azole. In large clinical trials, ﬂuconazole demonstrated efﬁcacy comparable to that	
of AmB deoxycholate for the treatment of candidemia [21, 22]	
and is also considered to be standard therapy for oropharyngeal,	
esophageal, and vaginal candidiasis, as well as urinary tract infections [53, 54]. Fluconazole is readily absorbed, with oral bioavailability resulting in concentrations equal to approximately	
90% of those achieved by intravenous administration [55]. Absorption is not affected by food consumption, gastric pH, or disease state. Among the triazoles, ﬂuconazole has the greatest	
penetration into the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and vitreous,	
achieving concentrations of >70% of those in serum [56–59].	
For this reason, it is often used in the treatment of CNS and intraocular Candida infections. Fluconazole achieves urine concentrations that are 10–20 times the concentrations in serum	
and, thus, is the preferred treatment option for symptomatic	
cystitis [59]. For patients with invasive candidiasis, ﬂuconazole

on 11 August 2018	
should be administered with an average loading dose of 800 mg	
(12 mg/kg), followed by an average daily dose of 400 mg (6 mg/	
kg). The higher-dose level (800 mg daily, 12 mg/kg) is often recommended for therapy of susceptible C. glabrata infections, but	
this has not been validated in clinical trials. Fluconazole elimination is almost entirely renal; thus, a dose reduction is needed	
in patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/minute.	
Itraconazole is only available in oral formulations. It has not	
been well studied for invasive candidiasis, and is generally reserved for patients with mucosal candidiasis, especially those	
who have experienced treatment failure with ﬂuconazole [60].	
Gastrointestinal absorption is variable among patients and is	
greater for the oral solution compared with the capsule formulation. Histamine receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors result in decreased absorption of the capsule formulation,	
whereas acidic beverages enhance absorption [61]. Administration of the capsule formulation with food increases absorption,	
but the oral solution is better absorbed on an empty stomach	
[62]. Oral formulations are dosed in adults at 200 mg 3 times	
daily for 3 days, then 200 mg once or twice daily thereafter.	
Voriconazole has demonstrated effectiveness for both mucosal and invasive candidiasis [23,63].Its clinical use has been primarily for step-down oral therapy in patients with infection due	
to C. krusei and ﬂuconazole-resistant, voriconazole-susceptible	
C. glabrata. CSF and vitreous concentrations are >50% of serum	
concentration, and voriconazole has been shown to be efﬁcacious in case series for these infection sites [64–66]. Voriconazole does not accumulate in active form in the urine and thus	
should not be used for urinary candidiasis. The oral bioavailability of voriconazole is excellent and is not affected by gastric	
pH, but it decreases when the drug is administered with food	
[67,68]. In adults, the recommended oral dosing regimen for candidiasis includes a loading dose of 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily	
for 2 doses, followed by 200–300 mg (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily.	
Intravenous voriconazole is complexed to a cyclodextrin molecule; after 2 loading doses of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours, a maintenance dosage of 3–4 mg/kg every 12 hours is recommended.	
Because of the potential for cyclodextrin accumulation and	
possible nephrotoxicity among patients with signiﬁcant renal	
dysfunction, intravenous voriconazole is not currently recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/minute.	
However, retrospective examination of intravenous voriconazole use in patients with varying degrees of renal function	
below this cutoff value has not identiﬁed toxic effects, mitigating some of these concerns [69, 70]. Oral voriconazole does not	
require dosage adjustment for renal insufﬁciency, but it is the	
only triazole that requires dosage reduction for patients with	
mild to moderate hepatic impairment [71].	
Common polymorphisms in the gene encoding the primary	
metabolic enzyme for voriconazole result in wide variability of	
serum levels [72]. Drug–drug interactions are common with	
voriconazole and should be considered when initiating and	
discontinuing treatment with this compound [52]. Voriconazole has not been studied systematically in ﬂuconazole-resistant	
Candida species, and with the exception of C. krusei, use is currently discouraged. Each of the triazoles can be associated with	
uncommon side effects. However, several effects are unique to	
voriconazole or more commonly associated with higher voriconazole concentrations, including hepatic injury, visual side effects, photosensitivity, periostitis, and CNS side effects [73–75].	
Posaconazole does not have an indication for primary candidiasis therapy. It demonstrates in vitro activity against Candida	
species that is similar to that of voriconazole, but clinical data	
are inadequate to make an evidence-based recommendation	
for treatment of candidiasis other than oropharyngeal candidiasis [76]. Posaconazole is currently available as an extended-release tablet, an oral suspension, and an intravenous solution.	
The tablet formulation, given as 300 mg twice daily for 2 doses,	
then 300 mg daily produces predictable serum concentrations	
and excellent drug exposure and requires only once-daily dosing [77, 78].The oral suspension has unpredictable bioavailability [79–81]. Intravenous posaconazole is given as 300 mg twice	
daily for 2 doses, then 300 mg daily.	
Isavuconazole is a recently approved expanded-spectrum triazole antifungal with excellent in vitro activity against Candida	
species. Preliminary analysis of the recently completed large international double-blind trial comparing isavuconazole to an	
echinocandin for invasive candidiasis suggests that isavuconazole did not meet criteria for noninferiority (personal communication, Astellas US).	
Echinocandins	
Caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin are available only	
as parenteral preparations [82–84]. The minimum inhibitory	
concentrations (MICs) of the echinocandins are low for most	
Candida species, including C. glabrata and C. krusei [48–50].	
However, recent case series have described treatment failure associated with resistant strains of C. glabrata [85, 86]. Candida	
parapsilosis demonstrates innately higher MICs to the echinocandins than do most other Candida species, which raises the	
concern that C. parapsilosis may be less responsive to the	
echinocandins.	
Each of these agents has been studied for the treatment of	
esophageal candidiasis [24, 87, 88] and invasive candidiasis	
[25–34], and each has demonstrated efﬁcacy in these situations.	
Recent pooled analyses of almost exclusively nonneutropenic	
patients included in randomized invasive candidiasis treatment	
trials suggest a survival advantage associated with initial echinocandin therapy [19].	
All echinocandins have minimal adverse effects. The pharmacologic properties in adults are also very similar, and each	
is administered once daily intravenously [82–84]. Echinocandins achieve therapeutic concentrations in all infection	
sites with the exception of the eye, CNS, and urine [59]. The

major route of elimination is nonenzymatic degradation. None	
of the echinocandins require dosage adjustment for renal insufﬁciency or dialysis. Both caspofungin and micafungin undergo	
minimal hepatic metabolism, but neither drug is a major substrate for cytochrome P450. Caspofungin is the only echinocandin for which dosage reduction is recommended for patients	
with moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction. The usual intravenous dosing regimens for invasive candidiasis are as follows:	
caspofungin: loading dose 70 mg, then 50 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading dose 200 mg, then 100 mg daily; and micafungin:	
100 mg daily (no loading dose needed).	
Flucytosine	
Flucytosine demonstrates broad antifungal activity against most	
Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei. The compound is available in the United States only as an oral formulation. The drug has a short half-life (2.4–4.8 hours) and	
is ordinarily administered at a dosage of 25 mg/kg 4 times	
daily for patients with normal renal function. Flucytosine	
demonstrates excellent absorption after oral administration	
(80%–90%), and most of the drug is excreted unchanged	
(microbiologically active) in the urine [89, 90]; dose adjustment	
is necessary for patients with renal dysfunction [91, 92].The	
compound exhibits high penetration into the CNS and eye.	
Concentration-dependent toxicity results in bone marrow suppression and hepatitis.	
Flucytosine is usually given in combination with another antifungal agent due to a high rate of emergence of resistance during monotherapy [93]. The most common use of ﬂucytosine in	
the setting of Candida infection is in combination with AmB for	
patients with more refractory infections, such as Candida endocarditis, meningitis, or endophthalmitis. Occasionally, it is used	
for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract candidiasis due	
to ﬂuconazole-resistant C. glabrata [94].	
Pediatric Dosing	
There is considerable variation in the pharmacokinetics of antifungal agents between adult and pediatric patients, and the	
data on dosing in pediatric patients are limited. The pharmacological properties of antifungal agents in children and infants	
have been reviewed in detail [95]. The optimal dose of AmB deoxycholate in neonates has not been clearly deﬁned; a dosage of	
1 mg/kg is generally used [96–98]. The safety, efﬁcacy, area	
under the curve, and maximal concentration of ABLC 2–5	
mg/kg day are similar in adults and children [99]. The pharmacokinetics of liposomal AmB in neonates and children suggest	
that both volume and clearance are affected by weight [100].	
Flucytosine clearance is directly proportional to glomerular	
ﬁltration rate, and infants with a very low birth weight may	
accumulate high plasma concentrations because of poor renal	
function due to immaturity [101]. Thus, the use of ﬂucytosine	
without careful monitoring of serum drug levels is discouraged	
in this group of patients.	
Fluconazole pharmacokinetics vary with age, and the drug	
is rapidly cleared in children. Thus, a daily ﬂuconazole dose	
of 12 mg/kg is necessary for neonates and children [102–105].	
Voriconazole pharmacokinetics are also highly variable in children [106–108]. To attain plasma exposures comparable to	
those in adults receiving 4 mg/kg every 12 hours, a loading	
dose of intravenous voriconazole of 9 mg/kg twice daily, followed by 8 mg/kg twice daily is recommended in children.	
The recommended oral dose is 9 mg/kg twice daily (maximum	
dose 350 mg) [95, 107]. There are no data on voriconazole dosing in children <2 years old, and there are no pediatric studies	
examining the pharmacokinetics of the intravenous formulation, the oral suspension, or the extended-release tablets of	
posaconazole.	
Caspofungin and micafungin are approved by the US Food	
and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children. Caspofungin dosing is based on body surface area rather than weight. Dosing in children is a loading dose of 70 mg/m2, followed by 50 mg/	
m2/day. Preliminary studies suggest an optimal dose of caspofungin in neonates of 25 mg/m2/day. The current recommendation	
for micafungin for invasive candidiasis is 2 mg/kg/day, with the	
option to increase to 4 mg/kg/day in children <40 kg. The optimal dose of micafungin in neonates is unknown, but likely to be	
10 mg/kg/day or greater [109].Anidulafungin should be dosed at	
1.5 mg/kg/day for neonates and children [110–112].	
Considerations During Pregnancy	
AmB is the treatment of choice for invasive candidiasis in pregnant women [113]. Fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole,	
and isavuconazole should be avoided in pregnant women, especially those in the ﬁrst trimester, because of the possibility of	
birth defects associated with their use. Voriconazole is contraindicated during pregnancy because of fetal abnormalities	
observed in animals. There are few data concerning the echinocandins; thus, their use is cautioned during pregnancy. Flucytosine is contraindicated during pregnancy because of fetal	
abnormalities observed in animals.	
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring	
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and ﬂucytosine has been shown to be useful for optimizing efﬁcacy and limiting toxicity in patients	
receiving therapy for a variety of invasive fungal infections, including mucosal and invasive candidiasis [114]. The basis for	
TDM is widely variable concentrations among patients and a	
strong relationship between concentration and efﬁcacy and/or	
toxicity.	
For itraconazole, when measured by high-pressure liquid	
chromatography (HPLC), both itraconazole and its bioactive	
hydroxy-itraconazole metabolite are reported, the sum of	
which should be considered in assessing drug levels. Treatment	
success has been associated with concentrations ≥1 mg/L and	
toxicity with concentrations >5 mg/L. Bioassay levels are 3- to

7-fold higher than those measured by HPLC. Because of nonlinear pharmacokinetics in adults and genetic differences in metabolism, there is both intrapatient and interpatient variability	
in serum voriconazole concentrations [115–118]. TDM should	
be considered for patients receiving voriconazole, because drug	
toxicity has been observed at higher serum concentrations and	
reduced clinical response has been observed at lower concentrations [117, 118]. The therapeutic trough concentration window	
for voriconazole is 1–5.5 mg/L. Few data are available to support a speciﬁc concentration to optimize posaconazole efﬁcacy.	
Flucytosine monitoring is predominantly used to prevent concentration-associated toxicity. Peak concentrations <100 mg/L	
are recommended to avoid the predictable liver and bone marrow effects [119].	
Antifungal Susceptibility Testing	
Intensive efforts to develop standardized, reproducible, and relevant susceptibility testing methods for fungi have resulted in	
the development of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) methodologies for	
susceptibility testing of yeasts [120]. Interpretive breakpoints	
for susceptibility take into account the MIC, as well as pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data and animal model data. They	
are reported for each species. Breakpoints have been established	
for most, but not all, drugs for the 5 most common Candida	
species [47, 50, 121, 122] (Table 1).	
In many instances, clinical breakpoints have decreased from	
those used previously. For example, the prior Candida clinical	
breakpoint for susceptibility to ﬂuconazole was ≤8 mg/L. With	
the new interpretation, the susceptible value has been reduced to	
≤2 mg/L for C. albicans. For C. glabrata, there is no breakpoint	
established for susceptibility to ﬂuconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, or voriconazole (Table 1).	
When there is no clinical breakpoint established, the epidemiologic cutoff value (ECV) based on an examination of the	
distribution of MICs within a species can be used. The ECV	
is deﬁned as the MIC value that excludes non–wild type strains,	
notably isolates that are likely to contain a resistant mutant [50,	
123]. The addition of the ECV method is particularly useful for	
detecting emergence of resistance in a Candida species at an	
institution.	
The susceptibility of Candida to the currently available antifungal agents is generally predictable if the species of the infecting isolate is known. Currently, antifungal resistance in	
C. albicans is uncommon. However, individual isolates may	
not necessarily follow this general pattern [124]. Recent surveillance studies suggest that triazole resistance among C. glabrata	
isolates has increased to a degree that is it difﬁcult to rely upon	
these agents for therapy in the absence of susceptibility testing	
[12,125,126].A similar trend has begun to emerge for a smaller	
proportion of C. glabrata isolates and the echinocandins [35,85,	
125]. The value of susceptibility testing for other Candida species is less clear, although resistance among C. tropicalis and	
C. parapsilosis has been reported from tertiary care institutions	
that have extensive use of antifungal agents [127, 128]. Because	
of these trends, susceptibility testing is increasingly used to	
guide the management of candidemia and invasive candidiasis.	
Diagnosis of Candidiasis	
Cultures of blood or other samples collected under sterile conditions have long been considered diagnostic gold standards for	
invasive candidiasis. Nonculture diagnostic tests, such as

antigen, antibody, or β-D-glucan detection assays, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are now entering clinical practice as adjuncts to cultures. If used and interpreted	
judiciously, these tests can identify more patients with invasive candidiasis and better direct antifungal therapy. To	
fully realize the beneﬁts of combining culture and nonculture	
tests, however, clinicians must carefully consider the types of	
invasive candidiasis, understand the strengths and limitations	
of each assay, and interpret test results in the context of the	
clinical setting.	
Use of Cultures in the Diagnosis of Invasive Candidiasis	
Invasive candidiasis encompasses 3 entities: candidemia in the	
absence of deep-seated candidiasis, candidemia associated with	
deep-seated candidiasis, and deep-seated candidiasis in the absence of candidemia [20]. The distribution of these entities is	
likely to differ among centers; on balance, data suggest that	
the groups are approximately equal in size [129].	
The overall sensitivity of blood cultures for diagnosing invasive candidiasis is roughly 50% [20]. The limit of detection of	
blood cultures is ≤1 colony-forming unit/mL [130, 131]. The	
limit of detection for cultures is at or below that of PCR	
[132–135]. As such, blood cultures should be positive during	
the vast majority of active Candida bloodstream infections.	
They may be negative in cases of extremely low-level candidemia, intermittent candidemia, deep-seated candidiasis that persists after sterilization of the bloodstream, or deep-seated	
candidiasis resulting from direct inoculation of Candida in	
the absence of candidemia. Blood cultures are limited by slow	
turnaround times (median time to positivity of 2–3 days, ranging from 1 to ≥7 days), and the fact that they may become positive relatively late in the disease course [130, 136]. Cultures of	
tissues or ﬂuid recovered from infected sites during deep-seated	
candidiasis also exhibit poor sensitivity (often <50%) and slow	
turnaround times, and require invasive sampling procedures	
that may be dangerous or contraindicated due to underlying	
medical conditions [137].	
Antigen and Antibody Detection	
Candida antigen and anti-Candida antibody detection has	
gained greater acceptance in Europe than the United States.	
In general, antigen detection is limited by rapid clearance	
from the bloodstream [138]. Concerns have been expressed	
about the reliability of antibody detection in immunosuppressed hosts, but assays have performed well in patients with	
neutropenia and cell-mediated immune defects (including hematopoietic cell and solid organ transplant recipients) [138,	
139].Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses against speciﬁc	
antigens have typically performed better than immunoglobulin	
M (IgM) responses, suggesting that many patients mount amnestic responses or have ongoing, subclinical tissue invasion	
[139]. The best-studied test is a combined mannan/antimannan	
antibody assay, which is currently approved for use in Europe,	
but not the United States (Platelia Candida Ag and Ab; BioRad). In a meta-analysis of 14 studies, the sensitivity/speciﬁcity	
for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis of mannan and antimannan IgG individually were 58%/93% and 59%/83%, respectively [140]. Values for the combined assay were 83% and 86%,	
with best performances for C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis infections. In one study of candidemia, at least one test	
was positive before blood culture in 73% of patients [141]. In a	
study of hepatosplenic candidiasis, at least one test was positive	
before radiographic changes in 86% of patients [142]. This assay	
is not used widely in the United States, and its role in the diagnosis and management of invasive candidiasis is unclear.	
β-D-Glucan detection	
β-D-glucan is a cell wall constituent of Candida species, Aspergillus species, Pneumocystis jiroveci, and several other fungi. A	
serum β-D-glucan assay (Fungitell; Associates of Cape Cod,	
East Falmouth, Massachusetts) has been approved by the	
FDA as an adjunct to cultures for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. True-positive results are not speciﬁc for invasive	
candidiasis, but rather suggest the possibility of an invasive fungal infection. For this reason, among patient populations that	
are also at risk for invasive mold infections, such as hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, β-D-glucan offers a theoretical advantage over more narrow assays for candidiasis. β-D-glucan	
detection can identify cases of invasive candidiasis days to	
weeks prior to positive blood cultures, and shorten the time	
to initiation of antifungal therapy [143].Prophylactic or empiric	
antifungal treatment is likely to impact test performance. On	
the one hand, antifungal agents may reduce diagnostic sensitivity [144–146], but decreasing β-D-glucan levels may also correlate with responses to antifungal therapy [147].	
In meta-analyses of β-D-glucan studies, the pooled sensitivity	
and speciﬁcity for diagnosing invasive candidiasis were 75%–	
80% and 80%, respectively [144–146]. A number of issues complicate the interpretation of these data, including uncertainties	
about the best cutoff value for a positive result, number of positive tests required to establish a diagnosis, and optimal timing	
and frequency of testing among at-risk patients. There is	
marked heterogeneity among studies in how they address	
these issues, as well as in patient and control populations,	
range and type of fungal pathogens targeted, invasive candidiasis disease entities, distributions of Candida species, prior antifungal use, speciﬁc β-D-glucan assays employed, and other	
aspects of study design and statistical interpretation.	
The major concern about β-D-glucan detection is the potential for poor speciﬁcity and false positivity, which may be particularly problematic in the patient populations for which	
nonculture diagnostics would be most helpful. For example,	
false-positive results are rare in healthy controls, but decidedly	
more common among patients in an ICU [148]. Causes of	
false positivity include other systemic infections, such as

on 11 August 2018	
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia, certain antibiotics, such as intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate (not available	
in the United States), hemodialysis, fungal colonization, receipt	
of albumin or immunoglobulin, use of surgical gauze or other	
material containing glucan, and mucositis or other disruptions	
of gastrointestinal mucosa [149–154]. The speciﬁcity of β-Dglucan can be improved by requiring consecutive positive results rather than a single result, but false positivity remains a	
signiﬁcant limitation if the above-listed factors are common	
in the population tested. As an extreme example, the per-patient	
sensitivity/speciﬁcity and positive and negative predictive values	
of routine surveillance β-D-glucan testing in a recent study of	
lung transplant recipients were 64%/9% and 14%/50%, respectively [155]. Moreover, 90% of patients had at least one positive	
β-D-glucan result. Therefore, the test will be most useful if targeted to subgroups of patients whose clinical course or risk factors are particularly suggestive of invasive candidiasis or other	
fungal infection.	
The role of β-D-glucan testing of samples other than serum	
in the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is not established. Studies of β-D-glucan testing of CSF reported sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 95%–98%, respectively, for the diagnosis of	
non-Candida fungal CNS infections [156, 157]. β-D-glucan detection was highly sensitive and speciﬁc in a rabbit model of hematogenous C. albicans meningoencephalitis [158]. Limited	
data suggest that positive predictive values of β-D-glucan in	
bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid are poor for diagnosing fungal	
pneumonia [159]. There are case reports for testing of samples	
collected from other sites of invasive Candida infection [160].	
Limited data exist pertaining to the usefulness of β-D-glucan	
testing in children [161]. The optimal threshold for positivity of	
β-D-glucan testing in children is not known. In studies of uninfected immunocompetent individuals, mean β-D-glucan levels are slightly higher in children than adults [162]. Currently, it	
is not recommended to use β-D-glucan testing to guide pediatric clinical decision making.	
Polymerase Chain Reaction	
Candida PCR shares many of the potential beneﬁts and shortcomings of β-D-glucan detection. Compared to cultures, PCR	
assays of various blood fractions have been shown to shorten	
the time to diagnosis of invasive candidiasis and initiation of	
antifungal therapy [134, 135]. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of PCR for suspected invasive candidiasis in a recent metaanalysis were 95% and 92%, respectively [134]. In probable invasive candidiasis, sensitivity of PCR and blood cultures was	
85% and 38%, respectively. The impact of antifungal agents	
on diagnostic sensitivity was unclear. Data among patients colonized with Candida were surprisingly limited, but there was a	
trend toward lower speciﬁcity.	
A major limitation of PCR studies is the lack of standardized	
methodologies and multicenter validation of assay performance.	
A multicenter US study assessing the performance of a self-contained instrument that ampliﬁes and detects Candida DNA by	
PCR and T2 magnetic resonance (T2 Biosystems, Lexington,	
Massachusetts), respectively, has been completed [163]. This	
assay is FDA approved, but its role in the early diagnosis and	
management of candidemia remains unclear until more data	
are available. PCR has potential advantages over β-D-glucan	
or antigen-antibody assays, including the capacity for species	
identiﬁcation, detection of molecular markers for drug resistance, and multiplex formatting. In Europe, a whole-blood,	
multiplex real-time PCR assay (SeptiFast, Roche) that detects	
19 bacteria and 6 fungi (C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis,	
C. tropicalis, C. krusei, and Aspergillus fumigatus) has been investigated in several studies of sepsis and neutropenic fever.	
Among patients with candidemia in one study, the sensitivity	
of the test was 94%; the only negative result was observed	
with C. famata candidemia [164]. The role of PCR in testing	
samples other than blood is not established.	
Nonculture Diagnostic Testing for Blood Culture–Negative	
Invasive Candidiasis	
The overwhelming majority of studies have examined nonculture diagnostics in the setting of candidemia. More limited	
data on deep-seated candidiasis demonstrate how these tests	
may identify cases that are currently missed by blood cultures.	
In a single-center study of prospectively enrolled patients, the	
sensitivities/speciﬁcities of the Fungitell β-D-glucan assay and	
a real-time quantitative PCR assay (ViraCor-IBT, Lee’s Summit,	
Missouri) for invasive candidiasis were 56%/73% and 80%/70%,	
respectively [132]. More importantly, the sensitivities of contemporaneously collected blood cultures, β-D-glucan assay,	
and PCR samples among patients with deep-seated candidiasis	
(mostly intra-abdominal candidiasis) were 21%, 67%, and 88%,	
respectively. The combination of either a positive blood culture	
or positive β-D-glucan assay had sensitivity for invasive candidiasis of 79%; a positive blood culture or positive PCR sample	
was 98% sensitive. A second study investigated the serum β-Dglucan assay, Candida score (a predictive score for invasive candidiasis based on clinical parameters and burden of Candida	
colonization), and Candida colonization indices (predictive	
scores based on burden of colonization) among prospectively	
enrolled patients who were in surgical ICUs at 2 hospitals and	
who were at particularly high risk for intra-abdominal candidiasis [143]. The sensitivity/speciﬁcity of 2 consecutive positive βD-glucan results was 65%/78%. In contrast, the sensitivity of	
blood cultures was only 7%. In addition to identifying cases	
missed by blood cultures, the β-D-glucan assay was positive a	
median of 5 and 6 days prior to positive intra-abdominal cultures and institution of antifungal therapy, respectively. The	
sensitivities of Candida scores and colonization indices were	
comparable to β-D-glucan, but speciﬁcities were poorer	
(≤43%).

The interpretation of speciﬁcity in these studies was complicated by the fact that negative controls were also at risk for invasive candidiasis. Therefore, it is unclear if positive test results	
for controls were false positives (as deﬁned in the studies) or	
true positives that were missed due to the poor sensitivity of	
intra-abdominal and blood cultures. Indeed, this is a central	
challenge in assessing new diagnostics for invasive candidiasis:	
How can test performance be accurately measured when the	
gold standard is inadequate?	
I. What Is the Treatment for Candidemia in Nonneutropenic Patients?	
Recommendations	
1. An echinocandin (caspofungin: loading dose 70 mg, then	
50 mg daily; micafungin: 100 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading dose 200 mg, then 100 mg daily) is recommended as initial therapy (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
2. Fluconazole, intravenous or oral, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily is an acceptable alternative to an echinocandin as initial therapy in selected	
patients, including those who are not critically ill and who	
are considered unlikely to have a ﬂuconazole-resistant Candida species (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
3. Testing for azole susceptibility is recommended for all	
bloodstream and other clinically relevant Candida isolates.	
Testing for echinocandin susceptibility should be considered	
in patients who have had prior treatment with an echinocandin and among those who have infection with C. glabrata	
or C. parapsilosis (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
4. Transition from an echinocandin to ﬂuconazole (usually	
within 5–7 days) is recommended for patients who are clinically stable, have isolates that are susceptible to ﬂuconazole	
(eg, C. albicans), and have negative repeat blood cultures following initiation of antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
5. For infection due to C. glabrata, transition to higher-dose	
ﬂuconazole 800 mg (12 mg/kg) daily or voriconazole 200–	
300 (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily should only be considered	
among patients with ﬂuconazole-susceptible or voriconazole-susceptible isolates (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
6. Lipid formulation AmB (3–5 mg/kg daily) is a reasonable	
alternative if there is intolerance, limited availability, or resistance to other antifungal agents (strong recommendation;	
high-quality evidence).	
7. Transition from AmB to ﬂuconazole is recommended after	
5–7 days among patients who have isolates that are susceptible to ﬂuconazole, who are clinically stable, and in whom repeat cultures on antifungal therapy are negative (strong	
recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
8. Among patients with suspected azole- and echinocandinresistant Candida infections, lipid formulation AmB (3–5 mg/	
kg daily) is recommended (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
9. Voriconazole 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses, then	
200 mg (3 mg/kg) twice daily is effective for candidemia, but	
offers little advantage over ﬂuconazole as initial therapy	
(strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Voriconazole is recommended as step-down oral therapy for selected	
cases of candidemia due to C. krusei (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
10. All nonneutropenic patients with candidemia should have	
a dilated ophthalmological examination, preferably performed by an ophthalmologist, within the ﬁrst week after diagnosis (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
11. Follow-up blood cultures should be performed every day or	
every other day to establish the time point at which candidemia has been cleared (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
12. Recommended duration of therapy for candidemia without	
obvious metastatic complications is for 2 weeks after documented clearance of Candida species from the bloodstream	
and resolution of symptoms attributable to candidemia	
(strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Candidemia has emerged as one of the most common causes of	
healthcare-associated bloodstream infections, and in many US	
hospitals, candidemia represents the third or fourth most common hospital-acquired bloodstream isolate. In most clinical settings, C. albicans is the most commonly isolated species, but the	
non-albicans Candida species together represent approximately	
50% of the bloodstream isolates, and this has been a growing	
trend in many hospitals throughout the world for more than	
a decade [8–12].	
There are signiﬁcant challenges in treating candidemia and invasive candidiasis. First, the infection is associated with high	
mortality. Earlier therapy is associated with better overall outcomes [14–18], but there remain signiﬁcant limitations to early	
diagnosis. The development of rapid diagnostic assays has been	
slow; thus, clinicians continue to rely on cultures to establish a	
diagnosis [20]. Second, there is considerable geographic, centerto-center, and even unit-to-unit variability of species causing	
candidemia [12]; each Candida species presents its own unique	
challenges with respect to virulence, pathogenicity, and antifungal susceptibility. Third, despite the overall robust nature of the	
randomized controlled trials examining treatment of candidemia	
and other forms of invasive candidiasis, no single trial has demonstrated the clear superiority of one therapeutic agent over another	
[19, 21–34]. Fourth, the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant	
Candida species will complicate the selection of antifungal therapy	
in the immediate future [10, 12, 35–38].	
The selection of any particular agent for the treatment of	
candidemia should take into account a history of recent azole or

echinocandin exposure, a history of intolerance to an antifungal	
agent, the dominant Candida species and current susceptibility	
data in a particular clinical unit, severity of illness, relevant comorbidities, and evidence of involvement of the CNS, cardiac	
valves, and/or visceral organs. The risk of mortality among patients with candidemia ranges from 10% to 47% [6–8, 13], but	
the actual disease-associated mortality is more likely 10%–20%,	
with the risk of death being related to increasing age, higher	
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE	
II) scores, infecting Candida species, immunosuppressive	
agents, preexisting renal dysfunction, venous catheter retention,	
and antifungal selection [8, 19, 165–167]. Early initiation of effective antifungal therapy and source control is critical in the	
successful treatment of candidemia, as demonstrated by data	
suggesting signiﬁcantly higher mortality rates among patients	
with candidemia in whom antifungal therapy was delayed or	
considered inadequate, and/or in whom source control was	
not promptly attained [14, 16–18, 168].	
The echinocandins demonstrate signiﬁcant fungicidal activity against most Candida species, and each of these agents has	
demonstrated success in approximately 70%–75% of patients	
in randomized, comparative clinical trials [24–28, 31, 32]. Despite the need for intravenous administration, their superb efﬁcacy, favorable safety proﬁle, limited drug interactions, and	
concerns about ﬂuconazole resistance have led many experts	
to favor the echinocandins as initial therapy for most adult patients with candidemia. Few studies comparing different echinocandins have been performed [28, 169], but most experts	
agree that these agents are sufﬁciently similar to be considered	
interchangeable.	
Only one study comparing an echinocandin to ﬂuconazole	
has been performed, and the results from this study suggest a	
strong trend toward more favorable outcomes with anidulafungin	
compared with ﬂuconazole as primary therapy for candidemia	
[27]. In a subanalysis of patients with C. albicans infections,	
there was a signiﬁcant improvement in global response among	
those receiving anidulafungin [31].In another subanalysis of critically ill patients from this trial, those receiving anidulafungin had	
signiﬁcantly better responses at end of therapy compared with	
ﬂuconazole-treated patients [170]. A combined analysis of 7 of	
the largest randomized clinical trials comparing treatment for	
candidemia and invasive candidiasis and involving almost	
2000 patients found that initial therapy with an echinocandin	
was a signiﬁcant predictor of survival [19]. This same analysis	
identiﬁed higher APACHE II score, older age, and infection	
with C. tropicalis to be associated with worse outcomes and	
higher mortality [19].	
It has become common practice for clinicians treating patients with candidemia to initiate an echinocandin, then change	
to an oral azole (typically ﬂuconazole) once the patient has become clinically stable [1]. A recent open-label noncomparative	
trial assessed outcomes of patients who were treated with	
anidulafungin for at least 5 days followed by step-down therapy	
to oral ﬂuconazole or voriconazole (if the infecting organism	
was susceptible) when they were clinically stable and blood cultures had become negative [34]. There was no difference noted	
in outcomes among patients who continued on anidulafungin	
throughout the treatment course compared with those who	
were changed to an oral azole. Smaller pilot studies from	
Latin America and Asia demonstrated similar ﬁndings [33,	
171]. Thus, on the basis of these data and other clinical trials	
[22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 33, 34, 171], the Expert Panel favors stepdown therapy to ﬂuconazole or voriconazole for patients who	
have improved clinically following initial therapy with an echinocandin, have documented clearance of Candida from the	
bloodstream, and who are infected with an organism that is	
susceptible to ﬂuconazole (eg, C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and	
C. tropicalis) or voriconazole (eg, C. krusei). This transition usually occurs within 5–7 days, but this time is variable and ultimately dependent on patient response and clinician preference.	
In many parts of the world, based on success rates reported	
from well-designed clinical trials, ﬂuconazole remains standard	
therapy for patients with candidemia [21–23, 27]. However, in	
light of recent data on the efﬁcacy of echinocandins and increasing resistance to ﬂuconazole, the Expert Panel believes that ﬂuconazole should be considered ﬁrst-line therapy only in patients	
who are hemodynamically stable, who have had no previous exposure to azoles, and who do not belong in a group at high risk	
for C. glabrata infection, including those who are elderly, have	
underlying malignancy, or are diabetic.	
In previous iterations of these guidelines, the Expert Panel favored ﬂuconazole over an echinocandin for treatment of candidemia due to C. parapsilosis based on reports of decreased in	
vitro activity of echinocandins against this species and of echinocandin resistance among some isolates [11, 12, 172–175]. In	
spite of these laboratory observations, there have been no clinical studies that have demonstrated superiority of ﬂuconazole	
over the echinocandins for the treatment of C. parapsilosis infections. Moreover, recent observational data from Spain among	
almost 200 patients with candidemia due to C. parapsilosis suggested no difference in outcome among patients who received	
initial treatment with an echinocandin compared with those	
who received other regimens [176]. Any recommendation supporting ﬂuconazole over an echinocandin is generally based on	
theoretical concerns rather than on observed therapeutic failure	
of the echinocandins in these patients.	
Voriconazole was shown to be as effective for candidemia	
and invasive candidiasis as the comparator regimen of sequential therapy with AmB for 4–7 days followed by ﬂuconazole	
[23]. Voriconazole possesses activity against most Candida species, including C. krusei [177, 178], but the need for more frequent administration, less predictable pharmacokinetics, more	
drug interactions, and poor tolerance to the drug make it less	
attractive for initial therapy. Parenteral voriconazole appears

on 11 August 2018	
to be safe when administered to those with baseline renal dysfunction, despite concerns based on possible nephrotoxicity	
of its vehicle (sulfobutylether β-cyclodextrin) [70]. Voriconazole does not provide predictable activity against ﬂuconazoleresistant C. glabrata [47, 177–179]. It does, however, ﬁll an	
important niche for patients who have ﬂuconazole-resistant isolates of C. krusei, C. guilliermondii, or C. glabrata that are voriconazole susceptible and who are ready for transition from an	
echinocandin or AmB to oral therapy.	
There is little role for oral itraconazole for the treatment of	
candidemia, given the similar antifungal spectrum, ease of administration, superior pharmacokinetics, and better tolerability	
of ﬂuconazole. Posaconazole has excellent in vitro activity	
against most Candida species. The extended-release tablet and	
the intravenous formulation could prove useful in the future,	
but currently there is no role for posaconazole in the treatment	
of candidemia. The broad-spectrum azole isavuconazole demonstrates similar in vitro activity against Candida species, as	
do voriconazole and posaconazole, and could prove useful in	
the future [180].	
AmB has broad activity against all Candida species with the	
exception of C. lusitaniae, which is frequently resistant. Lipid	
formulations of AmB are preferred to AmB deoxycholate and	
should be considered when there is a history of intolerance to	
echinocandins and/or azoles, the infection is refractory to	
other therapy, the organism is resistant to other agents, or	
there is a suspicion of infection due to non-Candida yeasts,	
such as Cryptococcus neoformans or Histoplasma capsulatum.	
Liposomal AmB, 3 mg/kg daily, has been shown to be as effective as micafungin for treatment of candidemia [26].	
The emergence of echinocandin-resistant and echinocandin-/azole-resistant Candida isolates, especially C. glabrata,	
clearly has been documented, and this ﬁnding appears to be associated with worse clinical outcomes [10, 12, 35–37, 181, 182].	
Fluconazole resistance is a frequent ﬁnding among echinocandin-resistant isolates [9, 10], further complicating therapeutic	
choices. There are currently no prospective data to inform a decision, but the Expert Panel favors lipid formulation AmB for	
treatment of patients with candidemia due to proven or suspected ﬂuconazole and echinocandin-resistant (multidrug resistant)	
strains until more data become available.	
Recent data suggest that as many as 16% of patients with candidemia have some manifestation of ocular involvement, and	
some of these patients will develop severe, sight-threatening endophthalmitis [70]. Thus, for all patients with candidemia, the	
Expert Panel strongly advises a dilated funduscopic examination, preferably performed by an ophthalmologist, within the	
ﬁrst week after initiation of speciﬁc antifungal therapy. Some	
groups have suggested that it is possible to stratify patients according to risk in an effort to avoid performing ophthalmologic	
examinations on all candidemic patients [183]. This approach is	
possibly more cost-effective than examining all patients	
with candidemia, but the potential beneﬁt of early identiﬁcation of endophthalmitis and prevention of visual loss far outweighs the expense of performing a dilated funduscopic	
examination.	
Follow-up blood cultures every day or every other day until	
demonstration of clearance of Candida from the bloodstream	
are helpful to establish the appropriate duration of antifungal	
therapy. If there are no metastatic complications of candidemia,	
the duration of therapy with systemic antifungal agents should be	
14 days following documented clearance of Candida species from	
the bloodstream and resolution of signs and symptoms attributable to infection. This recommendation is based on the results of	
several prospective, randomized trials in which this rule has been	
universally and successfully applied, and it is generally associated	
with few complications and relapses [21–23, 26–28, 30, 32–34].	
II. Should Central Venous Catheters Be Removed in Nonneutropenic	
Patients With Candidemia?	
Recommendation	
13. CVCs should be removed as early as possible in the course	
of candidemia when the source is presumed to be the CVC	
and the catheter can be removed safely; this decision should	
be individualized for each patient (strong recommendation;	
moderate-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Central venous catheters and other intravascular devices are important risk factors in the development and persistence of candidemia in nonneutropenic patients [5, 7–9, 184]. A CVC is	
present in at least 70% of nonneutropenic patients with candidemia at the time that the diagnostic blood culture is obtained	
[5, 7–9, 170, 184–187]. The relationship of candidemia to CVCs	
has been assumed on the basis of observation, clinical experience, and an understanding of the role of bioﬁlm in the genesis	
of bloodstream infections [188, 189]. That candidemia in nonneutropenic patients is commonly due to contaminated CVCs	
is undeniable, but there remains controversy as to how best to	
distinguish a catheter-associated candidemia from one that is	
related to another source, such as the gastrointestinal tract.	
There have been no prospective clinical studies designed to	
examine CVC management as a primary measurement related	
to outcome. Moreover, several retrospective analyses have led to	
very different conclusions regarding the necessity and timing of	
CVC removal in the candidemic patient [19, 190–193]. Thus,	
the controversy continues, with some groups arguing for a	
strictly individualized approach to each patient [190]and others	
for an approach that removes CVCs in all nonneutropenic candidemic patients in whom it is safe and feasible to do so [19].No	
prospective study has demonstrated a survival beneﬁt to early	
CVC removal in patients who have candidemia, but most studies have demonstrated a shorter duration of candidemia and/or	
a trend toward improved outcomes [14, 21–23, 27, 28, 168, 192–	
200]. The recent combined analysis of 7 candidemia trials

on 11 August 2018	
observed a survival beneﬁt among those who underwent CVC	
removal at some time during treatment for candidemia [19].	
The survival beneﬁt applied to patients across all levels of severity of illness as determined by APACHE II scores.	
The Expert Panel members strongly believe that CVCs	
should be removed if this can be performed safely when candidemia is documented in the nonneutropenic patient. It is intuitive that each patient with candidemia must be managed	
individually with respect to CVC removal or retention, but on	
balance, the bulk of data supports an approach that leads to	
early removal among nonneutropenic patients in whom the	
catheter is a likely source of infection.	
Among neutropenic patients, the role of the gastrointestinal	
tract as a source for disseminated candidiasis is evident from	
autopsy studies, but in an individual patient, it is difﬁcult to determine the relative contributions of the gastrointestinal tract vs	
the CVC as the primary source of candidemia [195, 201]. An	
exception is made for candidemia due to C. parapsilosis,	
which is very frequently associated with CVCs [188, 189, 200,	
202]. A recent retrospective analysis that included mostly nonneutropenic patients underscored the inﬂuence of early CVC	
removal, speciﬁcally among patients with C. parapsilosis bloodstream infection, on clinical outcome [176].	
III. What Is the Treatment for Candidemia in Neutropenic Patients?	
Recommendations	
14. An echinocandin (caspofungin: loading dose 70 mg, then	
50 mg daily; micafungin: 100 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading	
dose 200 mg, then 100 mg daily) is recommended as initial	
therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
15. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, is an effective	
but less attractive alternative because of the potential for toxicity (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
16. Fluconazole, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400	
mg (6 mg/kg) daily, is an alternative for patients who are	
not critically ill and have had no prior azole exposure	
(weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
17. Fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, can be used for stepdown therapy during persistent neutropenia in clinically stable	
patients who have susceptible isolates and documented bloodstream clearance (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
18. Voriconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses,	
then 200–300 mg (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily, can be used in situations in which additional mold coverage is desired (weak	
recommendation; low-quality evidence). Voriconazole can	
also be used as step-down therapy during neutropenia in	
clinically stable patients who have had documented bloodstream clearance and isolates that are susceptible to voriconazole (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
19. For infections due to C. krusei, an echinocandin, lipid formulation AmB, or voriconazole is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
20. Recommended minimum duration of therapy for candidemia without metastatic complications is 2 weeks after documented clearance of Candida from the bloodstream, provided	
neutropenia and symptoms attributable to candidemia have resolved (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
21. Ophthalmological ﬁndings of choroidal and vitreal infection are minimal until recovery from neutropenia; therefore,	
dilated funduscopic examinations should be performed within the ﬁrst week after recovery from neutropenia (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
22. In the neutropenic patient, sources of candidiasis other	
than a CVC (eg, gastrointestinal tract) predominate. Catheter	
removal should be considered on an individual basis (strong	
recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
23. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–mobilized	
granulocyte transfusions can be considered in cases of persistent candidemia with anticipated protracted neutropenia	
(weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Candidemia that develops in neutropenic patients is a lifethreatening infection associated with acute disseminated candidiasis, a sepsis-like syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death.	
Outcomes are particularly poor in people with protracted neutropenia, such as that which develops after induction therapy	
for hematologic malignancies [190, 203,204].Candidemia associated with C. tropicalis is associated with particularly poor outcomes in neutropenic hosts. Chronic disseminated candidiasis	
(hepatosplenic candidiasis) can ensue as a complication of candidemia in neutropenic patients, especially when patients with	
gastrointestinal tract mucositis do not receive antifungal prophylaxis. There are no adequately powered randomized controlled trials of treatment of candidemia in neutropenic	
patients. The data are largely derived from single-arm studies,	
small subsets of randomized controlled studies that have enrolled mostly nonneutropenic patients, and pooled outcomes	
from randomized trials [205, 206].	
Historically, candidemia in neutropenic patients was treated	
with an AmB formulation. The availability of voriconazole and	
the echinocandins has led to greater use of these agents, but	
without compelling clinical data. The extensive use of ﬂuconazole for prophylaxis to prevent invasive candidiasis in neutropenic patients and the lack of meaningful prospective data has led	
to a diminished therapeutic role for this agent among these patients, except for use as maintenance, or step-down therapy	
after organism species and susceptibilities are obtained in clinically stable patients [207].	
The numbers of neutropenic patients included in candidemia	
treatment studies are small. In these trials, 50% of caspofungin	
recipients vs 40% of AmB deoxycholate recipients [25], 68% of	
micafungin recipients vs 61% of liposomal AmB recipients [26],	
and 69% of micafungin recipients vs 64% of caspofungin

on 11 August 2018	
recipients [28] with neutropenia at onset of therapy were successfully treated. The randomized controlled trial of anidulafungin vs ﬂuconazole enrolled too few neutropenic patients with	
candidemia to generate meaningful data regarding efﬁcacy	
[27]. In 2 retrospective studies, successful outcomes for primary	
treatment of neutropenic patients were reported in 64% of those	
receiving AmB deoxycholate, 64% of those receiving ﬂuconazole, and 68% of those receiving caspofungin [29, 208].	
Additional insights can be gleaned from data derived from	
studies of empiric antifungal therapy involving febrile patients	
with neutropenia who had candidemia at baseline. In these studies, baseline candidemia was cleared in 73% of those treated with	
AmB deoxycholate vs 82% of those treated with liposomal AmB	
[209] and in 67% of those treated with caspofungin vs 50% of	
those treated with liposomal AmB [210]. Data from a large randomized trial also suggest that voriconazole is a reasonable choice	
for febrile patients with neutropenia and suspected invasive candidiasis for whom additional mold coverage is desired [211].	
A systematic review was conducted to analyze available data	
generated in treatment trials and empiric therapy trials that enrolled neutropenic patients [205].This included 17 trials that randomized 342 neutropenic patients with documented invasive	
candidiasis. Pooling of results favored use of nonpolyenes to	
AmB-containing comparators. Another pooled analysis that	
summarized results of treating with micafungin or comparators	
(liposomal AmB or caspofungin) for candidemia in the setting	
of malignancy-associated neutropenia from 2 randomized trials	
demonstrated success rates ranging from 53% to 85%, but no signiﬁcant differences among treatment groups [206].	
On the basis of these limited data, the success rates of antifungal therapy for candidemia in patients with neutropenia do	
not appear to be substantially different from those reported in the	
large randomized trials of nonneutropenic patients. However, conclusions may be limited by signiﬁcant enrollment bias of selected	
patients. Although these data do not suggest less favorable outcomes associated with ﬂuconazole and voriconazole, many experts	
prefer lipid formulation AmB or an echinocandin, which are	
fungicidal, as ﬁrst-line agents. Similar to the approach in nonneutropenic patients, the recommended duration of therapy for candidemia in neutropenic patients is for 14 days after resolution of	
attributable signs and symptoms and clearance of the bloodstream	
of Candida species, provided that there has been recovery from	
neutropenia. When neutropenia is protracted, an antifungal drug	
should be continued until engraftment. This recommendation is	
based on limited data from prospective randomized trials and	
has been associated with few complications and relapses [209,210].	
The management of intravascular catheters in neutropenic patients with candidemia is less straightforward than in their nonneutropenic counterparts. Distinguishing gut-associated from	
vascular catheter–associated candidemia can be difﬁcult in these	
patients [201]. The data for catheter removal are less compelling,	
and catheter removal often creates signiﬁcant intravenous access	
problems. An analysis of 842 patients enrolled in 2 phase 3 treatment trials failed to demonstrate signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁts of	
catheter removal in multivariable analyses that adjusted for other	
measures of prognostic signiﬁcance [190]. The Expert Panel suggests that catheter removal should be considered on an individual	
basis, taking into account feasibility and risk of removal.	
An extremely important factor inﬂuencing the outcome of	
candidemia in neutropenic patients is the recovery of neutrophils during therapy. In multiple cohort studies of patients	
with cancer who had candidemia, and pooled analyses of randomized trials, persistent neutropenia was associated with a	
greater chance of treatment failure [190, 203, 204, 212]. This	
has led to improvement of strategies to harvest granulocytes	
from donors (including community volunteers), using G-CSF	
mobilization, which has been shown to be safe and feasible	
[213]. Analysis of subsets of people within phase 1/2 granulocyte infusion studies, retrospective observations, and small cohort studies suggest that G-CSF–mobilized granulocyte	
transfusions may be of beneﬁt in patients with persistent candidemia and prolonged neutropenia [213–215]. In a randomized	
controlled trial, granulocyte infusions were associated with few	
toxicities, but small numbers of patients in infection subgroups	
limited conclusions of efﬁcacy [216]. The panel recommends	
consideration of granulocyte infusions in select situations,	
when such technology is feasible.	
IV. What Is the Treatment for Chronic Disseminated (Hepatosplenic)	
Candidiasis?	
Recommendations	
24. Initial therapy with lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily	
OR an echinocandin (micafungin: 100 mg daily; caspofungin:	
70-mg loading dose, then 50 mg daily; or anidulafungin: 200mg loading dose, then 100 mg daily), for several weeks is recommended, followed by oral ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg)	
daily, for patients who are unlikely to have a ﬂuconazoleresistant isolate (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
25. Therapy should continue until lesions resolve on repeat	
imaging, which is usually several months. Premature discontinuation of antifungal therapy can lead to relapse (strong	
recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
26. If chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation is	
required, it should not be delayed because of the presence of	
chronic disseminated candidiasis, and antifungal therapy	
should be continued throughout the period of high risk to prevent relapse (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
27. For patients who have debilitating persistent fevers, short	
term (1–2 weeks) treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs or corticosteroids can be considered (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

malignancies and who have just recovered from neutropenia	
[217–219]. Candida albicans is the species most commonly isolated, but C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and other Candida	
species also have been implicated. Fever, right upper quadrant	
discomfort, nausea, and elevation of liver enzymes occur following return of neutrophils and persist for months unless treatment is initiated. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography	
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission	
tomography-CT (PET-CT), and sometimes ultrasound have	
all been shown to be useful for diagnosis and for follow-up	
[217, 218, 220, 221]. Biopsy of lesions may reveal budding yeasts	
and hyphae, but organisms may not be seen on biopsy specimens and often do not grow in culture, leading some to suggest	
that chronic disseminated candidiasis represents an immune reconstitution syndrome [219].	
Approaches to the treatment of chronic disseminated candidiasis are based on anecdotal case reports and open-label series. Early experience with AmB was discouraging; as many as	
one-third of patients died within 3 months with active infection, and the overall mortality was 74% [222]. With the use of	
newer antifungal agents, mortality has decreased to 21% overall and is highly linked to relapse of leukemia [223]. Lipid formulations of AmB have proved more efﬁcacious, perhaps	
related to better tissue concentrations [217, 218, 224, 225]. Fluconazole alone or following AmB induction has been shown to	
be effective [226, 227]. Increasingly, patients are receiving ﬂuconazole prophylaxis, and thus have an increased risk of developing infection with a ﬂuconazole-resistant organism. In this	
population, a broader-spectrum azole or an echinocandin is	
more appropriate therapy. Only a few reports note experience	
with voriconazole or posaconazole for this condition, but echinocandins are increasingly used to treat this infection [219,	
223, 228–231].	
Antifungal therapy should be given until all lesions have resolved radiographically in order to prevent relapse. MRI or	
PET-CT appear to be the most sensitive follow-up modalities,	
but are expensive [220, 221]; standard contrast-enhanced CT	
is less expensive and is adequate for follow-up. Additional chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplant should be pursued	
when clinically appropriate and not delayed because of candidiasis. However, antifungal therapy must be continued during the	
period of immunosuppression to prevent relapse of infection	
[219, 223, 228–231].	
There is evidence that this syndrome could possibly be a form	
of immune reconstitution and that corticosteroids or antiinﬂammatory agents might have a role in selected patients.	
Several investigators have reported rapid defervescence and	
improvement in liver enzyme tests when corticosteroids have	
been given in conjunction with antifungal agents [219, 223,	
232, 233]. The dosage of corticosteroids has generally been	
0.5–1 mg/kg daily of oral prednisone. The duration of steroid	
treatment, although highly variable, in most cases has been	
several weeks, given as a tapering dose [232, 233]. However,	
the role of corticosteroids in this disease is still not clear.	
V. What Is the Role of Empiric Treatment for Suspected Invasive	
Candidiasis in Nonneutropenic Patients in the Intensive Care Unit?	
Recommendations	
28. Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered in critically ill patients with risk factors for invasive candidiasis and	
no other known cause of fever and should be based on clinical assessment of risk factors, surrogate markers for invasive	
candidiasis, and/or culture data from nonsterile sites (strong	
recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Empiric antifungal therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients who have the above risk factors and who have	
clinical signs of septic shock (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
29. Preferred empiric therapy for suspected candidiasis in	
nonneutropenic patients in the ICU is an echinocandin (caspofungin: loading dose of 70 mg, then 50 mg daily; micafungin: 100 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading dose of 200 mg,	
then 100 mg daily) (strong recommendation; moderatequality evidence).	
30. Fluconazole, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400	
mg (6 mg/kg) daily, is an acceptable alternative for patients	
who have had no recent azole exposure and are not colonized	
with azole-resistant Candida species (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
31. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, is an alternative	
if there is intolerance to other antifungal agents (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
32. Recommended duration of empiric therapy for suspected	
invasive candidiasis in those patients who improve is 2	
weeks, the same as for treatment of documented candidemia	
(weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
33. For patients who have no clinical response to empiric antifungal therapy at 4–5 days and who do not have subsequent	
evidence of invasive candidiasis after the start of empiric	
therapy or have a negative non-culture-based diagnostic	
assay with a high negative predictive value, consideration	
should be given to stopping antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Candida species are an increasing cause of invasive infection in	
nonneutropenic patients in the ICU; half to two-thirds of all episodes of candidemia occur in an ICU [5,14,167,170,234].Candida bloodstream infections are associated with increased ICU	
and hospital stay [129,235].Most estimates of attributable mortality rates for invasive candidiasis in this setting are 30%–40%	
[167, 170]. In those patients who have septic shock due to Candida species and who do not have adequate source control or	
antifungal therapy begun within 24 hours, the mortality approaches 100% [14]. Prompt initiation of appropriate antifungal

on 11 August 2018	
therapy has been associated with as much as a 50% reduction in	
mortality [14, 17, 18, 236]. Prompt and appropriate antifungal	
therapy is often delayed because of the relative insensitivity of	
blood cultures, the time needed for blood cultures to yield growth,	
the possibility of negative blood cultures with invasive abdominal	
candidiasis, and the lack of speciﬁc clinical signs and symptoms.	
Strategies for initiating empiric antifungal therapy include an	
evaluation of risk factors and use of surrogate markers.	
Optimal utilization of risk factors and colonization status to derive clinical scoring systems and the interpretation of non-culturebased diagnostic tests to identify patients with invasive candidiasis	
to initiate earlyempiric antifungal therapy have been the subjects of	
many investigations. Retrospective and single-center studies have	
yielded conﬂicting results, depending on unique patient populations. Well-designed prospective clinical trials in this area have	
been difﬁcult to perform, and many unanswered questions remain.	
Risk factors for development of invasive candidiasis include	
Candida colonization, severity of illness, exposure to broadspectrum antibiotics, recent major surgery, particularly abdominal surgery, necrotizing pancreatitis, dialysis, parenteral nutrition, corticosteroids, and the use of CVCs [237, 238]. Empiric	
therapy based solely on colonization with Candida species appears inadequate [16, 239]. Prospective studies evaluating the	
extent of Candida colonization with scores or indices have	
not been shown to change management, and they are labor intensive and expensive [234].	
Several studies have looked at prediction models to identify	
patients at highest risk. These studies are characterized by	
high speciﬁcity, but low sensitivity, thus missing many patients	
with candidiasis [240–242]. A subset of postsurgical patients,	
particularly those with recurrent gastrointestinal perforation,	
anastomotic leaks, or acute necrotizing pancreatitis may be at	
uniquely high risk for candidiasis [238, 240, 243, 244]. The	
most important combination of factors in an individual patient	
has not been established.	
Surrogate markers that have been evaluated in the ICU setting include β-D-glucan, mannan-antimannan antibodies, and	
PCR testing. β-D-glucan appears to be more sensitive than Candida colonization scores or indices, but appears to have low positive predictive value [245–248]. False-positive results are a	
problem, as noted in the Background section. The optimal timing and number of samples is unknown. In a recent prophylaxis	
trial of high-risk ICU patients, β-D-glucan testing performed	
twice weekly identiﬁed 87% of patients with proven candidiasis	
[249]. Small studies basing preemptive therapy on β-D-glucan	
testing suggest that the high negative predictive value of this	
test could be useful in excluding invasive candidiasis in the	
ICU setting [151, 248, 250–252].	
Combined mannan-antimannan testing has variable sensitivity and speciﬁcity [142, 253]. Real-time PCR appears to	
have similar sensitivity to β-D-glucan for the diagnosis of	
candidemia, but may be more sensitive for the diagnosis of	
other forms of invasive candidiasis [132]. Tests using magnetic biosensor technology for the rapid detection of Candida	
species from whole-blood samples (T2 Biosystems) are also	
promising [163]. Recommendations for the clinical use of	
these tests are challenging without robust data in the at-risk	
ICU population.	
Limited clinical studies have evaluated the efﬁcacy of empiric	
strategies. Retrospective studies indicate potential for higher	
survival when empiric antifungal therapy is given to high-risk	
patients [254]. Prospective clinical trials of empiric antifungal	
therapy in the ICU are difﬁcult to conduct and have yielded	
conﬂicting results. Selected older studies, including those in	
speciﬁc patient populations, such as those with prior gastrointestinal surgery or bowel perforation, demonstrated potential	
beneﬁt [255, 256]. In a randomized clinical trial of ICU patients	
at risk for invasive candidiasis and with unexplained fever, empiric ﬂuconazole (800 mg daily for 14 days) was not associated	
with better outcomes when compared with placebo [257]. A recent study comparing caspofungin to placebo among ICU patients with signs of infection, Candida colonization, and clinical	
risk factors for invasive candidiasis was stopped prematurely	
due to poor patient accrual, conﬁrming the difﬁculty in conducting these trials [249].	
Widespread use of antifungal agents must be balanced	
against the cost, the risk of toxicity, and the emergence of resistance. None of the existing clinical trials have been adequately	
powered to assess the risk of the emergence of azole or echinocandin resistance. Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered in critically ill patients with risk factors for invasive	
candidiasis and no other known cause of fever. Preference	
should be given to an echinocandin in hemodynamically unstable patients, those previously exposed to an azole, and in those	
colonized with azole-resistant Candida species. Fluconazole	
may be considered in hemodynamically stable patients who	
are colonized with azole-susceptible Candida species or who	
have no prior exposure to azoles. There are no data guiding	
the appropriate duration of empiric antifungal therapy among	
patients who have a clinical response to therapy, but it is logical	
that it should not differ from the treatment of documented candidemia. Conversely, therapy can be stopped after several days	
in the absence of clinical response if cultures and surrogate	
markers are negative.	
VI. Should Prophylaxis Be Used to Prevent Invasive Candidiasis in the	
ICU Setting?	
Recommendations	
34. Fluconazole, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400	
mg (6 mg/kg) daily, could be used in high-risk patients in	
adult ICUs with a high rate (>5%) of invasive candidiasis	
(weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
35. An alternative is to give an echinocandin (caspofungin: 70mg loading dose, then 50 mg daily; anidulafungin: 200-mg

loading dose and then 100 mg daily; or micafungin: 100 mg	
daily) (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
36. Daily bathing of ICU patients with chlorhexidine, which	
has been shown to decrease the incidence of bloodstream infections including candidemia, could be considered (weak	
recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Time to appropriate therapy in candidemia appears to have a signiﬁcant impact on the outcome of patients with this infection [14,	
17, 18]. However, insensitivity and signiﬁcant delays using culture	
techniques, as well as limitations of rapid diagnostic tests, remain	
for this common cause of bloodstream infection among patients	
in the ICU [258,259].A safe and effective prophylactic strategy to	
prevent candidemia among high-risk patients could be of great	
beneﬁt [260]. The approach to prophylaxis has been either	
broad, in which all patients within the ICU setting are treated	
[261, 262], or selective, in which only speciﬁc high-risk groups	
of patients are targeted for prophylaxis [249, 263, 264].	
For ICUs that show very high rates of invasive candidiasis, in	
excess of the expected rates of <5% of patients, antifungal prophylaxis may be warranted in selected patients who are at highest risk [260]. Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have	
shown a reduction in the incidence of invasive candidiasis in	
single units or single hospitals when ﬂuconazole prophylaxis	
was used broadly in the ICU; one study targeted all patients	
in a surgical ICU [262] and, in the other, all patients receiving	
mechanical ventilation [261]. In both studies, Candida urinary	
tract infections, as well as invasive candidiasis and candidemia,	
were included as endpoints.	
In a blinded placebo-controlled trial that enrolled a small	
number of patients, ﬂuconazole prophylaxis was shown to decrease Candida intra-abdominal infections in high-risk patients	
in the surgical ICU [263]. A noncomparative, open-label trial	
using caspofungin prophylaxis in a small number of similar	
high-risk surgical patients also showed beneﬁt [264]. A recent	
multicenter placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trial of caspofungin prophylaxis targeting only those ICU patients who	
met speciﬁc criteria for high risk for invasive candidiasis	
showed a trend toward reduction of invasive candidiasis, but	
was limited by the sample size [249].	
Several meta-analyses have assessed the issue of ﬂuconazole	
prophylaxis in ICU patients [265–268]. Not surprisingly, there	
were methodological differences among the studies, and there	
was variation among the study populations. All 4 meta-analyses	
showed that ﬂuconazole prophylaxis was associated with a reduction in invasive candidiasis, but only 2 showed a reduction in	
candidemia [267, 268]. Importantly, only one analysis showed a	
reduction in mortality from invasive candidiasis [268]. None of	
the meta-analyses assessed the issues of adverse effects of antifungal agents, the emergence of resistance to ﬂuconazole, or	
major ecological shifts in Candida species, topics of great	
importance in the ICU setting. A Cochrane analysis conﬁrmed	
the importance of focusing prophylactic efforts on high-risk patients, noting that the number needed to treat to prevent one	
case of invasive candidiasis in the ICU setting varied from 9	
in high-risk patients to 188 in low-risk patients [269].	
Few data exist on risk factors for candidemia in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients. A population-based, casecontrol study conducted in a large tertiary care pediatric center	
found an incidence of candidemia of 3.5 per 1000 PICU admissions [270]. The presence of a CVC, a diagnosis of malignancy,	
and receipt of either vancomycin or an antianaerobic antimicrobial agent for >3 days were independently associated with	
the development of candidemia. Children who had ≥3 of	
these risk factors in different combinations had a predicted	
probability of developing candidemia of between 10% and 46%.	
Data are accruing on the use of skin decolonization with antiseptic agents in the ICU to decrease bloodstream infections,	
including those caused by Candida species [271–274]. Several	
multicenter randomized clinical trials have shown that daily	
bathing of ICU patients with chlorhexidine decreases the incidence of both catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated	
hospital-acquired bloodstream infections [271–273]. These	
studies were aimed primarily at evaluating the impact on	
multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and provide few data	
on Candida infections. However, at least one of these trials	
found a signiﬁcant reduction in catheter associated Candida	
bloodstream infections [272]. A meta-analysis on the effects	
of daily chlorhexidine bathing included 10 studies performed	
in an ICU setting, only one of which was a randomized controlled trial. The conclusion was that chlorhexidine bathing reduced the incidence of bloodstream infections, including	
catheter-associated bacterial infections [274]. Although not	
proven to prevent candidemia, there is little risk to the use of	
chlorhexidine in ICU patients, and this practice may prove	
beneﬁcial.

Nervous System Infection?	
What Is the Treatment for Neonatal Invasive Candidiasis and	
Candidemia?	
Recommendations	
37. AmB deoxycholate, 1 mg/kg daily, is recommended for neonates with disseminated candidiasis (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
38. Fluconazole, 12 mg/kg intravenous or oral daily, is a reasonable alternative in patients who have not been on ﬂuconazole prophylaxis (strong recommendation; moderate-quality	
evidence).	
39. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, is an alternative,	
but should be used with caution, particularly in the presence	
of urinary tract involvement (weak recommendation; lowquality evidence).

40. Echinocandins should be used with caution and generally	
limited to salvage therapy or to situations in which resistance	
or toxicity preclude the use of AmB deoxycholate or ﬂuconazole (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
41. A lumbar puncture and a dilated retinal examination are	
recommended in neonates with cultures positive for Candida	
species from blood and/or urine (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
42. CT or ultrasound imaging of the genitourinary tract, liver,	
and spleen should be performed if blood cultures are persistently positive for Candida species (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
43. CVC removal is strongly recommended (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
44. The recommended duration of therapy for candidemia	
without obvious metastatic complications is for 2 weeks	
after documented clearance of Candida species from the	
bloodstream and resolution of signs attributable to candidemia (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Neonatal candidiasis occurs predominately in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Candida species are the third most common pathogen associated with bloodstream infection in NICUs	
in the United States [275]. However, the incidence of neonatal	
candidiasis has decreased dramatically over the past decade	
[276–278]. Neonatal candidiasis is associated with signiﬁcant	
risk of death, neurodevelopmental impairment in extremely	
low-birth-weight infants who weigh ≤1000 g, and increased	
healthcare costs [279–284]. The primary risk factor for neonatal	
candidiasis is prematurity with those neonates who have an extremely low birth weight at greatest risk. These infants are at high	
risk to have CNS involvement as a complication of candidemia	
[285, 286]. Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis account for	
80%–90% of neonatal invasive candidiasis [278, 287].	
Neonatal candidiasis differs from invasive disease in older patients in that neonates are more likely to present with nonspeciﬁc	
or subtle signs and symptoms of infection. Candida species invade virtually all tissues, including the retina, brain, heart, lung,	
liver, spleen, and joints [288].Endocarditis is an uncommon complication of candidiasis in neonates. Although meningitis is seen	
frequently in association with candidemia, approximately half of	
neonates with Candida meningitis do not have a positive blood	
culture [285]. CNS disease in the neonate typically manifests as	
meningoencephalitis and should be assumed to be present in	
the neonate who has candidemia and signs and symptoms suggesting meningoencephalitis, as CSF ﬁndings of Candida infection may be unreliable. Neurodevelopmental impairment is	
common in survivors; therefore, careful follow-up of neurodevelopmental parameters is important [279, 281, 282, 284].	
Recent studies have highlighted the signiﬁcance of candiduria	
in the absence of candidemia in this population [281].	
Extremely low-birth-weight infants with candiduria are at a	
substantial risk of death or neurodevelopmental impairment.	
Candiduria in this population should prompt an evaluation	
(blood cultures, lumbar puncture, and abdominal ultrasound)	
for disseminated Candida infection and warrants treatment.	
The recommendation to treat neonatal candidiasis with AmB	
deoxycholate or ﬂuconazole is based on small, single-center trials and 2 multicenter cohort studies [279, 289–291]. In contrast	
to adults and older children, AmB deoxycholate is well tolerated	
in neonates and does not seem to be associated with a high risk	
for nephrotoxicity. A recent comparative effectiveness study	
found that neonates treated with AmB lipid formulations had	
higher mortality than infants treated with AmB deoxycholate	
or ﬂuconazole [291]. The difference in outcomes seen with	
lipid AmB formulations may be related to inadequate penetration of these drugs into the kidneys, inadequate dosing for premature neonates, or unknown confounders. Based on the	
current evidence, ﬂuconazole and AmB deoxycholate are acceptable choices for therapy, and lipid formulations of AmB should	
be used with caution. There are few data on the use of echinocandins in neonates. There are concerns with echinocandins because concentrations in the CNS and in the urinary tract are low.	
Dosing of antifungal agents is substantially different for neonates than it is for older children and adults. Limited pharmacokinetic data exist regarding dosing of AmB deoxycholate in	
neonates, and the pharmacokinetics appear to be highly variable in this population [96, 97, 101]. The recommended dose	
of 1 mg/kg daily results in higher estimates of clearance in infants compared with older children and may partially explain	
why the drug is better tolerated in neonates [98]. The duration	
of therapy is based primarily on adult and pediatric data, and	
there are no data to guide duration speciﬁcally in neonates.	
Population pharmacokinetic studies have provided dosing information for ﬂuconazole in the neonatal population [105,292].	
Based on these studies, ﬂuconazole, 12/mg/kg daily, can be used	
to treat neonatal candidiasis. More recent data suggest that a	
loading dose of ﬂuconazole of 25 mg/kg achieves the therapeutic target more rapidly than traditional dosing [292]. However,	
further studies of this dosing scheme are required before it can	
be recommended. Failure to promptly remove or replace CVCs	
in infants with candidemia places the infant at increased risk of	
prolonged infection, mortality, and long-term irreversible neurodevelopmental impairment [198, 279]. Removal and replacement of the catheter at an anatomically distinct site should be	
performed unless contraindicated.	
What Is the Treatment for Central Nervous System Infections	
in Neonates?	
Recommendations	
45. For initial treatment, AmB deoxycholate, 1 mg/kg intravenous daily, is recommended (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence).

on 11 August 2018	
46. An alternative regimen is liposomal AmB, 5 mg/kg daily	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
47. The addition of ﬂucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily, may be	
considered as salvage therapy in patients who have not had a	
clinical response to initial AmB therapy, but adverse effects	
are frequent (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
48. For step-down treatment after the patient has responded to	
initial treatment, ﬂuconazole, 12 mg/kg daily, is recommended for isolates that are susceptible to ﬂuconazole (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
49. Therapy should continue until all signs, symptoms, and	
CSF and radiological abnormalities, if present, have resolved	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
50. Infected CNS devices, including ventriculostomy drains	
and shunts, should be removed if at all possible (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
There are limited data to guide therapy for CNS Candida infections in the neonate. All AmB preparations, including the lipid	
formulations, penetrate the CNS and have fungicidal activity in	
the CNS [44]. AmB deoxycholate and liposomal AmB were	
found to have greater antifungal efﬁcacy when studied in a rabbit model of Candida meningoencephalitis compared with the	
other formulations [44]. The clinician must weigh the beneﬁts	
and drawbacks of using liposomal AmB with its good CSF penetration but poor urine levels vs using AmB deoxycholate with	
less good CSF levels but better urine levels.	
The beneﬁt of adding ﬂucytosine for neonates with CNS candidiasis is uncertain. In the largest prospective study evaluating	
treatment outcomes of CNS candidiasis in neonates, the median	
time to clear CSF was longer for those who received ﬂucytosine	
plus AmB deoxycholate (17.5 days; 6 infants), compared with	
those who received only AmB deoxycholate (6 days; 18 infants)	
[279]. In addition, ﬂucytosine is poorly tolerated, and gastrointestinal side effects may hinder oral feeding in neonates. In general, ﬂucytosine is used only in neonates who have not	
responded to AmB alone.	
Data supporting the use of echinocandins in neonates are	
emerging; however, several key issues require further clariﬁcation. The optimal dose of echinocandins in neonates remains	
uncertain [109, 284, 293–297]. Furthermore, there are concerns	
regarding the penetration of echinocandins into the CSF. Echinocandins appear to penetrate brain tissue, but not the CSF, and	
achieve concentrations in brain shown to be effective in animal	
models when dosages higher than those recommended for humans have been used [298, 299]. Limited clinical data suggest	
that the echinocandins may be effective for the treatment of	
CNS infections in neonates, but are not adequate to recommend	
their use at this time [293].	
What Are the Recommendations for Prophylaxis in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Setting?	
Recommendations	
51. In nurseries with high rates (>10%) of invasive candidiasis, intravenous or oral ﬂuconazole prophylaxis, 3–6 mg/kg	
twice weekly for 6 weeks, in neonates with birth weights	
<1000 g is recommended (strong recommendation; highquality evidence).	
52. Oral nystatin, 100 000 units 3 times daily for 6 weeks, is an	
alternative to ﬂuconazole in neonates with birth weights	
<1500 g in situations in which availability or resistance preclude the use of ﬂuconazole (weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
53. Oral bovine lactoferrin (100 mg/day) may be effective in	
neonates <1500 g but is not currently available in US hospitals (weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Numerous studies examining ﬂuconazole prophylaxis for the	
prevention of invasive candidiasis in neonates have consistently	
demonstrated efﬁcacy and possibly reduced mortality [300–	
310]. Fluconazole, 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg twice weekly, signiﬁcantly reduced rates of invasive candidiasis in premature	
neonates weighing <1000 g in nurseries with a very high incidence of Candida infections [300, 302]. A 2007 Cochrane	
review of clinical trials of ﬂuconazole prophylaxis demonstrated efﬁcacy, with a typical relative risk of 0.23 and number	
needed to treat of 9. The number needed to treat varied substantially depending on the incidence of invasive candidiasis	
in a particular ICU. The majority of studies have demonstrated	
the safety of ﬂuconazole prophylaxis and lack of emergence of	
resistance.	
Enteral or orally administered nystatin has been shown to be	
effective in reducing invasive candidiasis in preterm infants	
[303, 311–313]. In one study, nystatin prophylaxis was also associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality [313]. However,	
there remains a paucity of data on nystatin prophylaxis in infants <750 grams (the group at highest risk), and nystatin	
may not always be able to be administered when there is an	
ileus, gastrointestinal disease, feeding intolerance, or hemodynamic instability. These clinical situations are very common	
in low-gestational-age premature infants and limit the broad	
applicability of nystatin prophylaxis as a preventive strategy.	
Lactoferrin is a mammalian milk glycoprotein involved in innate immunity. In a randomized trial of bovine lactoferrin in	
infants <1500 g, the incidence of late-onset sepsis was signiﬁcantly lower in the lactoferrin group than in the placebo	
group [314]. A secondary analysis of the clinical trial showed	
that lactoferrin also reduced the incidence of invasive fungal infections compared with placebo [314]. Further conﬁrmation of	
the efﬁcacy and safety of oral bovine lactoferrin for the prevention of invasive candidiasis is needed, especially in infants <750	
g, because there were only a few neonates in this category in this	
trial.

VIII. What Is the Treatment for Intra-abdominal Candidiasis?	
Recommendations	
54. Empiric antifungal therapy should be considered for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection	
and signiﬁcant risk factors for candidiasis, including recent	
abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
55. Treatment of intra-abdominal candidiasis should include	
source control, with appropriate drainage and/or debridement (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
56. The choice of antifungal therapy is the same as for the	
treatment of candidemia or empiric therapy for nonneutropenic patients in the ICU (See sections I and V) (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
57. The duration of therapy should be determined by adequacy	
of source control and clinical response (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Intra-abdominal candidiasis in patients who have had recent	
abdominal surgery or intra-abdominal events refers to a heterogeneous group of infections that includes peritonitis, abdominal	
abscess, and purulent or necrotic infection at sites of gastrointestinal perforation or anastomotic leak. Up to 40% of patients	
with secondary or tertiary peritonitis, as deﬁned by a multinational consensus panel, may develop intra-abdominal candidiasis with a high mortality rate [243, 244, 315, 316]. A subset of	
postsurgical patients, particularly those with recurrent gastroduodenal perforation, anastomotic leaks, or acute necrotizing	
pancreatitis, are at uniquely high risk for invasive candidiasis	
[243, 244, 263, 316–320]. In other settings, such as perforated	
appendicitis, invasive candidiasis appears to be a rare complication [316, 319]. Infections are often polymicrobial, with yeast	
noted in as high as 20% of all cases and 40% in patients with	
a recent gastroduodenal perforation [319, 320].	
Diagnosis is hampered by the lack of speciﬁc clinical signs and	
symptoms. Blood cultures are often negative [321]. A laboratory	
report of yeast isolated from an abdominal specimen must be	
evaluated to distinguish between contamination, colonization,	
and invasive infection. Swabs of superﬁcial wounds and specimens taken from intra-abdominal catheters that have been in	
place for >24 hours do not provide useful information and	
should not be performed. In contrast, the presence of yeast obtained from normally sterile intra-abdominal specimens (operative room specimens, and/or drains that have been placed within	
24 hours) in patients with clinical evidence for infection should	
be considered indicative of intra-abdominal candidiasis.	
The role of surrogate markers and Candida risk scores in this	
setting has not been established. There are limited data on the	
utility of using β-D-glucan in postsurgical patients with suspected intra-abdominal candidiasis. In one study, β-D-glucan had a	
72% positive predictive value and an 80% negative predictive	
value for distinguishing colonization from intra-abdominal invasive candidiasis and performed better than Candida colonization scores or indices [143].	
Clinical evidence for the use of antifungal therapy for patients with suspected intra-abdominal invasive candidiasis is	
limited. Most studies are small, uncontrolled, single-center, or	
performed in speciﬁc populations. Patients who have Candida	
species isolated from normally sterile abdominal cultures or	
drains placed within 24 hours and who have clinical evidence	
of infection should be treated for intra-abdominal candidiasis.	
Patients who have had gastroduodenal perforations, anastomotic leaks, necrotizing pancreatitis, or other intra-abdominal	
events without the isolation of Candida species and who are	
doing poorly despite treatment for bacterial infections may beneﬁt from empiric antifungal therapy. Several meta-analyses of	
antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk surgical ICU patients have	
yielded conﬂicting results [265–268].	
Source control with adequate drainage and/or debridement is	
an important part of therapy of intra-abdominal candidiasis	
[14]. The choice of antifungal agent should be guided by the	
Candida species isolated and knowledge of the local epidemiology, including antifungal susceptibility patterns. Duration of	
antifungal therapy should be guided by clinical response and	
the adequacy of source control.	
IX. Does the Isolation of Candida Species From the Respiratory Tract	
Require Antifungal Therapy?	
Recommendation	
58. Growth of Candida from respiratory secretions usually	
indicates colonization and rarely requires treatment with antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality	
evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
The isolation of Candida species from the respiratory tract is	
commonly encountered among patients who are in the ICU	
and are intubated or have a chronic tracheostomy. This almost	
always reﬂects colonization of the airways and not infection.	
Candida pneumonia and lung abscess are very uncommon	
[322, 323]. Only rarely after aspiration of oropharyngeal material has primary Candida pneumonia or abscess been documented [324, 325]. Pneumonia due to Candida species is	
generally limited to severely immunocompromised patients	
who develop infection following hematogenous spread to the	
lungs. CT scan of the thorax usually shows multiple pulmonary	
nodules. Isolation of Candida species from respiratory samples	
in a patient who is severely immunosuppressed should trigger a	
search for evidence of invasive candidiasis.	
Although the diagnosis of Candida pneumonia is supported	
by isolation of the organism from a bronchoalveolar lavage	
(BAL) specimen, a ﬁrm diagnosis requires histopathological evidence of invasive disease. Multiple prospective and retrospective	
autopsy studies consistently demonstrate the poor predictive

on 11 August 2018	
value of the growth of Candida from respiratory secretions, including BAL ﬂuid [326–328]. In one prospective study, none of	
77 patients who died in an ICU and who had clinical and radiologic evidence of pneumonia and a positive culture for Candida	
species from BAL or sputum demonstrated evidence of Candida	
pneumonia at autopsy [328]. Because of the rarity of Candida	
pneumonia, the extremely common ﬁnding of Candida in respiratory secretions, and the lack of speciﬁcity of this ﬁnding [329–	
331],a decision to initiate antifungal therapy should not be made	
on the basis of respiratory tract culture results alone.	
Recent observations suggest that colonization of the airway	
with Candida species is associated with the development of bacterial colonization and pneumonia [332–336]. Candida airway	
colonization was also associated with worse clinical outcomes	
and higher mortality in these studies. However, it is not clear	
if Candida airway colonization has a causal relationship to	
poorer outcomes or is simply a marker of disease severity.	
X. What Is the Treatment for Candida Intravascular Infections, Including	
Endocarditis and Infections of Implantable Cardiac Devices?	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Endocarditis?	
Recommendations	
59. For native valve endocarditis, lipid formulation AmB, 3–5	
mg/kg daily, with or without ﬂucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times	
daily, OR high-dose echinocandin (caspofungin 150 mg daily,	
micafungin 150 mg daily, or anidulafungin 200 mg daily) is	
recommended for initial therapy (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
60. Step-down therapy to ﬂuconazole, 400–800 mg (6–12 mg/	
kg) daily, is recommended for patients who have ﬂuconazole-susceptible Candida isolates, have demonstrated clinical	
stability, and have cleared Candida from the bloodstream	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
61. Oral voriconazole, 200–300 mg (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily, or	
posaconazole tablets, 300 mg daily, can be used as step-down	
therapy for isolates that are susceptible to those agents but	
not susceptible to ﬂuconazole (weak recommendation; very	
low-quality evidence).	
62. Valve replacement is recommended; treatment should continue for at least 6 weeks after surgery and for a longer duration	
in patients with perivalvular abscesses and other complications	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
63. For patients who cannot undergo valve replacement, longterm suppression with ﬂuconazole, 400–800 mg (6–12 mg/	
kg) daily, if the isolate is susceptible, is recommended (strong	
recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
64. For prosthetic valve endocarditis, the same antifungal regimens suggested for native valve endocarditis are recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Chronic suppressive antifungal therapy with ﬂuconazole,	
400–800 mg (6–12 mg/kg) daily, is recommended to prevent	
recurrence (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
The incidence of Candida endocarditis has increased concurrent	
with the general increase in Candida infections [337]. Endocarditis should be suspected when blood cultures are persistently positive, when a patient with candidemia has persistent fever despite	
appropriate treatment, or when a new heart murmur, heart failure, or embolic phenomena occur in the setting of candidemia	
[338]. Most cases occur following cardiac valvular surgery, but	
other risk factors include injection drug use, cancer chemotherapy, prolonged presence of CVCs, and prior bacterial endocarditis.	
The signs, symptoms, and complications are generally similar to	
those of bacterial endocarditis, except for the frequent occurrence	
of large emboli to major vessels. Cases are fairly evenly divided	
between C. albicans and non-albicans Candida species [339].	
Medical therapy of Candida endocarditis has occasionally	
been curative [340–348], but the optimum therapy for both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis in adults is a combination	
of valve replacement and a long course of antifungal therapy	
based on case reports, case series, cohort studies, a metaanalysis, and clinical experience [339, 349]. Valve repair and vegetectomy are alternatives to valve replacement. Most of the	
cases reported in the literature have been treated with AmB deoxycholate, with or without ﬂucytosine [339, 342, 349–355].	
Fluconazole monotherapy is associated with an unacceptably	
high rate of relapse and mortality [354]. However, ﬂuconazole	
is useful for step-down therapy.	
AmB deoxycholate and azoles have decreased activity when	
compared with echinocandins against bioﬁlms formed by Candida in vitro, and they penetrate poorly into vegetations. Echinocandins and lipid formulations of AmB demonstrate more potent	
activity against Candida bioﬁlms [356]. A prospective, openlabel clinical trial, cohort studies, and several case reports show	
a role for the echinocandins in the treatment of endocarditis	
[228, 346, 348, 357–365]. Higher dosages of the echinocandins	
are thought to be necessary to treat endocarditis [228, 365]. Caspofungin has been used as monotherapy and in combination with	
AmB, azoles, or ﬂucytosine in single case reports, but data are limited for the other echinocandins [346, 360, 361, 363, 365, 366].	
Lifelong suppressive therapy with ﬂuconazole has been used	
successfully after a course of primary therapy in patients for	
whom cardiac surgery is contraindicated; it has also been advocated to prevent late recurrence of Candida prosthetic valve endocarditis [360, 367, 368]. Because Candida endocarditis has a	
propensity to relapse months to years later, follow-up should be	
maintained for several years after treatment [350, 351].	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Infection of Implantable	
Cardiac Devices?	
Recommendations	
65. For pacemaker and implantable cardiac deﬁbrillator infections, the entire device should be removed (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

66. Antifungal therapy is the same as that recommended for	
native valve endocarditis (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
67. For infections limited to generator pockets, 4 weeks of antifungal therapy after removal of the device is recommended	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
68. For infections involving the wires, at least 6 weeks of antifungal therapy after wire removal is recommended (strong	
recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
69. For ventricular assist devices that cannot be removed, the	
antifungal regimen is the same as that recommended for native valve endocarditis (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence). Chronic suppressive therapy with ﬂuconazole, if	
the isolate is susceptible, for as long as the device remains in	
place is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
There are a few case reports and a single retrospective review of	
Candida infections of pacemakers and cardiac deﬁbrillators	
[369–374]. The entire device should be removed and antifungal	
therapy given for 4–6 weeks depending on whether the infection involves the wires in addition to the generator pocket	
[369, 371–374]. Medical therapy alone has failed [370].	
There are isolated case reports and a few case series on Candida infections of ventricular assist devices [375–378]. The Expert Panel believes that suppressive azole therapy after a full	
course of initial antifungal therapy is warranted. Many of	
these devices cannot be removed and suppression will be lifelong. The role of antifungal prophylaxis to prevent infection	
in all patients receiving an assist device remains controversial	
[378].	
What	
Is	
the	
Treatment	
for	
Candida	
Suppurative	
Thrombophlebitis?	
Recommendations	
70. Catheter removal and incision and drainage or resection of	
the vein, if feasible, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
71. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, OR ﬂuconazole,	
400–800 mg (6–12 mg/kg) daily, OR an echinocandin (caspofungin 150 mg daily, micafungin 150 mg daily, or anidulafungin 200 mg daily) for at least 2 weeks after candidemia	
(if present) has cleared is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
72. Step-down therapy to ﬂuconazole, 400–800 mg (6–12 mg/	
kg) daily, should be considered for patients who have initially	
responded to AmB or an echinocandin, are clinically stable,	
and have a ﬂuconazole-susceptible isolate (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
73. Resolution of the thrombus can be used as evidence to discontinue antifungal therapy if clinical and culture data are	
supportive (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Most experience treating suppurative thrombophlebitis has	
been with AmB deoxycholate. Fluconazole and caspofungin	
have also been successful in some cases [379–381], but other	
agents used for primary treatment of candidemia, including	
echinocandins and voriconazole, should be effective [382].	
Higher-than-usual doses of echinocandins should be used, similar to therapy for endocarditis.	
Surgical excision of the vein plays an important role in the	
treatment of peripheral-vein Candida thrombophlebitis. When	
a central vein is involved, surgery is usually not an option. In	
some cases, systemic anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy	
has been used as adjunctive therapy, but there are insufﬁcient	
data to recommend their use. Thrombolytic therapy, in conjunction with antifungal therapy, has been used successfully	
in the management of an infected thrombus attached to a	
CVC in a patient with persistent candidemia [381].	
XI. What Is the Treatment for Candida Osteoarticular Infections?	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Osteomyelitis?	
Recommendations	
74. Fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for 6–12 months OR	
an echinocandin (caspofungin 50–70 mg daily, micafungin	
100 mg daily, or anidulafungin 100 mg daily) for at least 2	
weeks followed by ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for	
6–12 months is recommended (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
75. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, for at least 2	
weeks followed by ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for	
6–12 months is a less attractive alternative (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
76. Surgical debridement is recommended in selected cases	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Most patients with osteomyelitis present with a subacute to	
chronic course [383,384].The most common mechanism of infection is hematogenous dissemination, but direct inoculation	
and contiguous spread of infection also occur. Involvement of	
2 or more bones is common, and therefore, when a single focus	
of infection is identiﬁed, there should be a search for other sites	
of involvement. The axial skeleton, especially the spine, is the	
most common site of involvement in adults; in children, the	
long bones are more commonly involved [228, 384–388]. Neither the clinical picture nor the ﬁndings on radiographic imaging are speciﬁc for Candida infection. Candida albicans remains	
the dominant pathogen. However, 2 retrospective reviews of a	
large number of cases found that non-albicans Candida were	
an increasingly frequent cause of Candida osteomyelitis and	
mixed infections with bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus, were not uncommon, underscoring the need for biopsy and	
culture [384, 389].

Treatment recommendations are based on case reports and	
case series. Historically, AmB deoxycholate has been the most	
commonly used agent [388]. Recent literature favors the use	
of ﬂuconazole or an echinocandin over AmB [228, 384–386].	
Fluconazole has been used successfully as initial therapy	
for patients who have susceptible isolates, but treatment	
failures have also been reported [390–393]. There are case	
reports of the successful treatment of osteomyelitis with	
itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin	
[228, 229, 394–396].	
Cure rates appear to be signiﬁcantly higher when an antifungal agent is administered for at least 6 months [384, 385]. The	
addition of AmB deoxycholate or ﬂuconazole to bone cement	
has been suggested to be of value as adjunctive therapy in complicated cases and appears to be safe, but this practice is controversial [397, 398].	
Surgical debridement is frequently performed in conjunction	
with antifungal therapy. Some reports have found surgical therapy important for Candida vertebral osteomyelitis [387], but	
others have not found that to be the case [388]. Surgery is indicated in patients who have neurological deﬁcits, spinal instability, large abscesses, or persistent or worsening symptoms during	
therapy [384].	
On the basis of a small number of cases, Candida mediastinitis and sternal osteomyelitis in patients who have undergone	
sternotomy can be treated successfully with surgical debridement followed by either AmB or ﬂuconazole [391, 399]. Irrigation of the mediastinal space with AmB is not recommended,	
because it can cause irritation. Antifungal therapy of several	
months’ duration, similar to that needed for osteomyelitis at	
other sites, is appropriate.	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Septic Arthritis?	
77. Fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for 6 weeks OR an	
echinocandin (caspofungin 50–70 mg daily, micafungin	
100 mg daily, or anidulafungin 100 mg daily) for 2 weeks	
followed by ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for at least	
4 weeks is recommended (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
78. Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, for 2 weeks, followed by ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, for at least 4	
weeks is a less attractive alternative (weak recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
79. Surgical drainage is indicated in all cases of septic arthritis	
(strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
80. For septic arthritis involving a prosthetic device, device removal is recommended (strong recommendation; moderatequality evidence).	
81. If the prosthetic device cannot be removed, chronic suppression with ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, if the isolate is susceptible, is recommended (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Adequate drainage is critical to successful therapy of Candida arthritis. In particular, Candida arthritis of the hip requires open	
surgical drainage. Case reports have documented cures with	
AmB, ﬂuconazole, and caspofungin therapy in combination	
with adequate drainage [400–402]. Administration of either	
AmB or ﬂuconazole produces substantial synovial ﬂuid levels, so	
that intra-articular injection of antifungal agents is not necessary.	
Candida prosthetic joint infection generally requires resection arthroplasty, although success with medical therapy alone	
has been described rarely [403, 404]. The combination of removal and reimplantation of the prosthesis in 2 stages separated	
by 3–6 months and a prolonged period of antifungal therapy for	
at least 12 weeks after the resection arthroplasty and at least 6	
weeks after prosthesis implantation is suggested on the basis	
of limited data [405–407]. The efﬁcacy of antifungal-loaded cement spacers is controversial [408]. If the prosthetic device cannot be removed, chronic suppression with an antifungal agent,	
usually ﬂuconazole, is necessary.	
XII. What Is the Treatment for Candida Endophthalmitis?	
What Is the General Approach to Candida Endophthalmitis?	
Recommendations	
82. All patients with candidemia should have a dilated retinal	
examination, preferably performed by an ophthalmologist,	
within the ﬁrst week of therapy in nonneutropenic patients	
to establish if endophthalmitis is present (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For neutropenic patients, it is	
recommended to delay the examination until neutrophil recovery (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
83. The extent of ocular infection (chorioretinitis with or without macular involvement and with or without vitritis) should	
be determined by an ophthalmologist (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
84. Decisions regarding antifungal treatment and surgical intervention should be made jointly by an ophthalmologist and	
an infectious diseases physician (strong recommendation;	
low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Endophthalmitis refers to infections within the eye, usually involving the posterior chamber and sometimes also the anterior	
chamber. Candida endophthalmitis can be exogenous, initially	
affecting the anterior chamber and occurring following trauma	
or a surgical procedure. More often, Candida species cause endogenous infection in which the organism reaches the posterior	
chamber of the eye via hematogenous spread. Endogenous infections can be manifested as isolated chorioretinitis or as chorioretinitis with extension into the vitreous, leading to vitritis	
[409–412]. Candida albicans is the species most commonly responsible for endogenous endophthalmitis, but all Candida	
species that cause candidemia have been reported to cause

on 11 August 2018	
this complication [411–414].Outcomes in terms of visual acuity	
depend on the extent of visual loss at the time of presentation	
and macular involvement [415].	
Several basic principles are important in the approach to treatment of Candida infections of the eye. It should ﬁrst be determined whether infection involves the anterior and/or posterior	
segment of the eye and whether the macula or vitreous are involved [70, 416–418]. Achieving adequate concentrations of the	
appropriate antifungal agent in the area of the eye that is infected	
is crucial to success [419, 420]. Infections involving the chorioretinal layer are more easily treated because this area of the posterior chamber is highly vascular; many systemic antifungal agents	
likely reach adequate concentrations within the choroid and the	
retina [420–422]. The antifungal susceptibilities of the infecting	
species are important. Species that are susceptible to ﬂuconazole	
or voriconazole are more easily treated because these agents	
achieve adequate concentrations in the posterior segment of	
the eye, including the vitreous [419, 420, 422]. Treatment must	
be systemic to treat candidemia and other organ involvement,	
if present, in addition to the ocular infection.	
Sight-threatening lesions near the macula or invasion into the	
vitreous usually necessitate intravitreal injection of antifungal	
agents, usually AmB deoxycholate or voriconazole, with or without vitrectomy, in addition to systemic antifungal agents [412,	
419, 422–425]. The ophthalmologist plays a key role in following	
the course of endogenous Candida endophthalmitis, deciding	
when and if to perform intravitreal injections and vitrectomy.	
The approach to the patient who has candidemia has	
evolved over time, and standard practice now includes consultation with an ophthalmologist to do a dilated retinal examination. The basis for the recommendation to perform an	
ophthalmological evaluation is not a result of randomized	
controlled trials showing the beneﬁts of such an assessment,	
but rather clinical judgment that the result of missing and	
not appropriately treating Candida endophthalmitis could	
be of great consequence to the patient. The issue of whether	
an ophthalmological examination of all candidemic patients	
is cost-effective has been raised [183, 426]. The members of	
the Expert Panel believe that the risk of missing Candida endophthalmitis outweighs the cost of obtaining an ophthalmological examination. We are concerned about the greater risk	
of loss of visual acuity in patients who are examined only after	
manifesting ocular symptoms [415], and note that other centers report higher rates of endophthalmitis than reports from	
the centers cited by those who question the routine use of ocular examination [417, 418, 421].	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Chorioretinitis Without	
Vitritis?	
Recommendations	
85. For ﬂuconazole-/voriconazole-susceptible isolates, ﬂuconazole, loading dose, 800 mg (12 mg/kg), then 400–800 mg	
(6–12 mg/kg) daily OR voriconazole, loading dose 400 mg	
(6 mg/kg) intravenous twice daily for 2 doses, then 300 mg	
(4 mg/kg) intravenous or oral twice daily is recommended	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
86. For ﬂuconazole-/voriconazole-resistant isolates, liposomal	
AmB, 3–5 mg/kg intravenous daily, with or without oral ﬂucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
87. With macular involvement, antifungal agents as noted	
above PLUS intravitreal injection of either AmB deoxycholate, 5–10 µg/0.1 mL sterile water, or voriconazole, 100 µg/	
0.1 mL sterile water or normal saline, to ensure a prompt	
high level of antifungal activity is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
88. The duration of treatment should be at least 4–6 weeks,	
with the ﬁnal duration depending on resolution of the	
lesions as determined by repeated ophthalmological examinations (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
The greatest clinical experience for treatment of Candida endophthalmitis has been with intravenous AmB deoxycholate,	
only because it has been available for the longest time. However,	
this agent does not achieve adequate concentrations in the posterior chamber [419, 420, 427, 428]. In animal experiments in	
inﬂamed eyes, liposomal AmB achieved higher concentrations	
in the eye than either AmB deoxycholate or AmB lipid complex	
[427]. A few patients have been treated successfully with lipid	
formulations of AmB, but concentrations in the vitreous in humans have not been reported [429].	
Flucytosine provides adjunctive synergistic activity when	
used with AmB; it should not be used as monotherapy because	
of development of resistance and reports of decreased efﬁcacy in	
animal models [428]. It attains excellent levels in the ocular	
compartments, including the vitreous [412, 430]. Toxicity is	
common, and ﬂucytosine serum levels must be monitored	
weekly to prevent dose-related toxicity.	
Fluconazole is frequently used for the treatment of Candida	
endophthalmitis. In experimental animals, this agent achieves	
excellent concentrations throughout the eye, including the vitreous [428]. In humans, concentrations in the vitreous are approximately 70% of those in the serum [57]. Clinical and	
microbiological response rates in animals with experimental infection are somewhat conﬂicting, with most reports showing efﬁcacy of ﬂuconazole, but some noting better efﬁcacy with AmB	
than ﬂuconazole [428, 431, 432]. Early reports in humans noted	
the efﬁcacy of ﬂuconazole, but some patients had received intravitreal injection of antifungal agents, as well as systemic ﬂuconazole [433, 434]. Despite the fact that no large published series	
has deﬁned the efﬁcacy of ﬂuconazole therapy, this agent is routinely used for the treatment of Candida endophthalmitis [410,	
411, 415, 421].

on 11 August 2018	
Voriconazole has played an increasing role in the treatment	
of endophthalmitis [419]. Concentrations in the vitreous in humans are approximately 40% of serum concentrations; the drug	
is relatively safe, and, like ﬂuconazole, can be given by the oral	
or intravenous route [435–438]. It is more active than ﬂuconazole against C. glabrata, although resistance is increasing and	
may preclude its use for some patients; it is uniformly active	
against C. krusei. Efﬁcacy of voriconazole in treating Candida	
endophthalmitis has been documented, but not compared	
with ﬂuconazole [429,436,438].Serum and (presumably) intraocular concentrations of voriconazole are quite variable, and	
serum trough levels should be routinely monitored to achieve	
concentrations between 2 µg/mL and 5 µg/mL to enhance efﬁcacy and avoid toxicity [118].	
There are few data regarding the use of posaconazole for	
Candida endophthalmitis. Intraocular penetration is poor,	
this agent has been used in very few patients, and it is not approved for the treatment of candidemia [419].	
Echinocandins are ﬁrst-line agents for the treatment of candidemia. Whether they can effectively treat chorioretinitis without vitreal involvement cannot be answered with the data	
available. Penetration of all echinocandins into the different	
chambers of the eye is poor, and is especially poor in the vitreous [412, 419, 420]. When levels have been achieved in experimental animal models and in one study in humans with	
micafungin, the dosages needed have been higher than those	
currently licensed for use [112, 439–443]. Only a few case reports of the use of an echinocandin as monotherapy have	
been published, and the results are contradictory [444, 445].	
With the availability of other agents that achieve adequate concentrations in the vitreous, there is little reason to recommend	
the use of echinocandins for Candida endophthalmitis.	
Because involvement of the macula is sight-threatening and	
concentrations of antifungal agents in the posterior chamber do	
not immediately reach therapeutic levels, many ophthalmologists	
perform an intravitreal injection of either AmB deoxycholate or	
voriconazole to quickly achieve high antifungal activity in the posterior chamber. AmB is the agent that has been used most often	
for intravitreal injection [422, 423]. A dosage of 5–10 µg given in	
0.1 mL sterile water is generally safe [419]. Intravitreal injection of	
lipid formulations of AmB has been compared with AmB deoxycholate in rabbits; all formulations showed toxicity at higher doses,	
but at 10 µg, the least toxic was liposomal AmB [446], conﬁrming	
a prior study using a noncommercial liposomal formulation [447].	
Voriconazole is increasingly used for intravitreal injection for	
both Candida and mold endophthalmitis [438, 448]. It has been	
shown to be safe in animal eyes at concentrations <250 µg/mL	
[449]. The usual dose given to humans is 100 µg in 0.1 mL sterile water or normal saline (achieving a ﬁnal concentration of 25	
µg/mL) [419, 438]. In vitrectomized eyes, the half-life of both	
AmB and voriconazole is shortened, and repeated injections	
may be required [450, 451].	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Chorioretinitis With	
Vitritis?	
Recommendations	
89. Antifungal therapy as detailed above for chorioretinitis	
without vitritis, PLUS intravitreal injection of either amphotericin B deoxycholate, 5–10 µg/0.1 mL sterile water, or	
voriconazole, 100 µg/0.1 mL sterile water or normal saline,	
is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
90. Vitrectomy should be considered to decrease the burden of	
organisms and to allow the removal of fungal abscesses that	
are inaccessible to systemic antifungal agents (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
91. The duration of treatment should be at least 4–6 weeks,	
with the ﬁnal duration dependent on resolution of the lesions	
as determined by repeated ophthalmological examinations	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Candida endophthalmitis that has extended into the vitreous	
results in worse visual outcomes than chorioretinitis without	
vitritis [415]. This may be related to the inability of many antifungal agents to achieve adequate concentrations in the vitreous	
body. Poor outcomes could also be due to an increased burden	
of organisms in the posterior chamber or the existence of an abscess that cannot be visualized through the vitreal haziness. Additionally, in cases of endophthalmitis in which fungemia is not	
documented and the organism is unknown, vitrectomy provides material for culture that is superior to needle aspiration	
and allows the proper antifungal agent to be used [422, 424].	
The treatment when vitritis is documented is similar to that	
recommended for chorioretinitis without vitreal involvement,	
with the added recommendations to (1) inject either AmB deoxycholate or voriconazole into the vitreous to achieve high	
drug concentrations in the posterior chamber and to (2) consider performing a pars plana vitrectomy. Several small series have	
noted success in patients in whom early pars plana vitrectomy	
was accomplished [415, 423, 424, 452]. Removal of the vitreous	
is usually accompanied by intravitreal injection of antifungal	
agents, and as noted above, the half-life of injected antifungal	
agents is shortened with vitrectomy [450, 451]. The risk of retinal detachment, a severe late complication of endophthalmitis	
with vitreal involvement, is decreased with early vitrectomy	
[412, 415]. To have the best outcomes, Candida endophthalmitis with vitritis must be managed with close cooperation between ophthalmologists and infectious diseases specialists.	
XIII. What Is the Treatment for Central Nervous System Candidiasis?	
Recommendations	
92. For initial treatment, liposomal AmB, 5 mg/kg daily,	
with or without oral ﬂucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily,	
is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).

93. For step-down therapy after the patient has responded to initial treatment, ﬂuconazole, 400–800 mg (6–12 mg/kg) daily, is	
recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
94. Therapy should continue until all signs and symptoms and	
CSF and radiological abnormalities have resolved (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
95. Infected CNS devices, including ventriculostomy drains,	
shunts, stimulators, prosthetic reconstructive devices, and biopolymer wafers that deliver chemotherapy, should be removed	
if possible (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
96. For patients in whom a ventricular device cannot be removed, AmB deoxycholate could be administered through	
the device into the ventricle at a dosage ranging from 0.01	
mg to 0.5 mg in 2 mL 5% dextrose in water (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
CNS Candida infections can occur as a manifestation of disseminated candidiasis, as a complication of a neurosurgical procedure, especially when an intracranial device is inserted, or rarely	
as an isolated chronic infection [453–462]. Meningitis is the	
most common presentation, but multiple small abscesses	
throughout the brain parenchyma, large solitary brain abscesses, and epidural abscesses have been reported [462]. Low-birthweight neonates are at high risk to have CNS infection as a	
complication of candidemia; neonatal CNS candidiasis is dealt	
with in the section on neonatal Candida infections. Most infections are due to C. albicans, with few reports of C. glabrata and	
other species causing infection [453–457, 459, 461, 462]. Treatment is based on the antifungal susceptibilities of the infecting	
species and the ability of the antifungal agent to achieve appropriate concentrations in the CSF and brain.	
No randomized controlled trials have been performed to evaluate the most appropriate treatment for these uncommon infections. Single cases and small series are reported. Most experience	
has accrued with the use of AmB deoxycholate, with or without	
ﬂucytosine [453–455, 457, 459, 460, 462]. Liposomal AmB (AmBisome) has been found to attain higher levels in the brain than	
amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) or AmB deoxycholate in a	
rabbit model of Candida meningoencephalitis [44].	
The combination of AmB and ﬂucytosine is recommended	
because of the in vitro synergism noted with the combination	
and the excellent CSF concentrations achieved by ﬂucytosine.	
However, ﬂucytosine’s toxic effects on bone marrow and liver	
must be carefully monitored, preferably with frequent serum	
ﬂucytosine levels. The optimal length of therapy with AmB	
alone or in combination with ﬂucytosine has not been studied.	
Several weeks of therapy are suggested before transitioning to	
oral azole therapy.	
Fluconazole achieves excellent levels in CSF and brain tissue	
and has proved useful as step-down therapy [453,454,459].Fluconazole also has been used as monotherapy; both success and	
failure have been noted, and for this reason it is not recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy [453, 454, 463–465]. Fluconazole	
combined with ﬂucytosine has been reported to cure Candida	
meningitis in a few patients [459], and this is a possible regimen	
for step-down therapy. There are no reports of the use of voriconazole or posaconazole for CNS candidiasis. Voriconazole	
achieves excellent levels in CSF, and should be considered	
for the rare case of C. glabrata that is not voriconazole	
resistant or C. krusei meningitis after initial treatment with	
AmB with or without ﬂucytosine. Posaconazole does not	
reach adequate concentrations in the CSF, and this agent is	
not recommended.	
Echinocandins have been used infrequently for CNS candidiasis. There are case reports noting success [466],but CNS breakthrough infections in patients receiving an echinocandin for	
candidemia have been reported [467]. There are experimental	
animal data noting that anidulafungin and micafungin can successfully treat C. albicans meningitis, but the doses required in	
humans are much higher than currently recommended for candidemia [296, 299]. At present, echinocandins are not recommended for CNS candidiasis.	
Infected CNS devices should be removed to eradicate Candida. Most experience has been with external ventricular drains	
and ventriculoperitoneal shunts that have become infected	
with Candida species [460, 463]. In recent years, infected devices include deep brain stimulators and Gliadel biopolymer wafers that have been placed into the site of a brain tumor to	
deliver chemotherapy locally. Although difﬁcult to remove, experience has shown that these devices must be taken out for	
cure of the infection [456, 468, 469].	
Intraventricular administration of antifungal agents is not usually necessary for treatment of CNS Candida infections. In patients in whom the removal of a ventricular shunt or external	
ventriculostomy drain is too risky because of signiﬁcantly elevated	
intracranial pressure, or among patients who have not responded	
to systemic antifungal therapy, intraventricular AmB deoxycholate	
has proved useful [453, 454, 460, 463, 469]. The dose of intraventricular AmB deoxycholate is not standardized, and recommendations vary from 0.01 mg to 1 mg in 2 mL of 5% dextrose in water	
daily [455,463,466,469].Toxicity—mainly headache, nausea, and	
vomiting—is a limiting factor when administering AmB by this	
route [454, 463].	
XIV. What Is the Treatment for Urinary Tract Infections Due to Candida

dissemination; high-risk patients include neutropenic patients, very low-birth-weight infants (<1500 g), and patients	
who will undergo urologic manipulation (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
99. Neutropenic patients and very low-birth-weight infants	
should be treated as recommended for candidemia (see sections III and VII) (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
100. Patients undergoing urologic procedures should be treated	
with oral ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, OR AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for several days before and after	
the procedure (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
The presence of candiduria is the usual trigger for a physician to	
consider whether a patient has a urinary tract infection due to	
Candida species. The patients at most risk for candiduria are	
those who are elderly, female, diabetic, have indwelling urinary	
devices, are taking antibiotics, and have had prior surgical procedures [470–475]. In the asymptomatic patient, candiduria almost always represents colonization, and elimination of	
underlying risk factors, such as indwelling catheters, is often adequate to eradicate candiduria [471].	
Multiple studies have noted that candiduria does not commonly lead to candidemia [471, 472, 476–480]. Several of	
these studies have shown that candiduria is a marker for greater	
mortality, but death is not related to Candida infection and	
treatment for Candida infection does not change mortality	
rates [476, 480, 481]. A prospective study in renal transplant recipients found that although mortality was higher in patients	
who had candiduria, treatment did not improve outcomes, suggesting again that candiduria is a marker for severity of underlying illness [482].	
Several conditions require an aggressive approach to candiduria in asymptomatic patients. These include neonates with	
very low birth weight, who are at risk for invasive candidiasis	
that often involves the urinary tract [281, 483]. Many physicians who care for neutropenic patients treat those who have	
fever and candiduria because the candiduria may indicate invasive candidiasis. However, a recent study from a cancer hospital of a small number of patients, 25% of whom were	
neutropenic, found that these patients did not develop candidemia or other complications of candiduria [484]. Several reports have documented a high rate of candidemia when	
patients undergo urinary tract instrumentation [485, 486],	
which has led to recommendations to treat with antifungal	
agents periprocedure.	
What Is the Treatment for Symptomatic Candida Cystitis?	
Recommendations	
101. For ﬂuconazole-susceptible organisms, oral ﬂuconazole,	
200 mg (3 mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks is recommended (strong	
recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
102. For ﬂuconazole-resistant C. glabrata, AmB deoxycholate,	
0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days OR oral ﬂucytosine, 25 mg/	
kg 4 times daily for 7–10 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
103. For C. krusei, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for	
1–7 days is recommended (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence).

200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks, is recommended	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
107. For ﬂuconazole-resistant C. glabrata, AmB deoxycholate,	
0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days, with or without oral ﬂucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
108. For ﬂuconazole-resistant C. glabrata, monotherapy with	
oral ﬂucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily for 2 weeks, could	
be considered (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
109. For C. krusei, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for	
1–7 days is recommended (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
110. Elimination of urinary tract obstruction is strongly recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
111. For patients who have nephrostomy tubes or stents in	
place, consider removal or replacement, if feasible (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Candida UTI can develop by 2 different routes [487]. Most	
symptomatic UTIs evolve as an ascending infection beginning	
in the lower urinary tract, similar to the pathogenesis of bacterial UTI. Patients with ascending infection can have symptoms	
of cystitis or pyelonephritis. The other route of infection occurs	
as a consequence of hematogenous spread to the kidneys in a	
patient who has candidemia. These patients usually have no urinary tract symptoms or signs, and are treated for candidemia.	
Diagnostic tests on urine often are not helpful in differentiating colonization from infection or in pinpointing the involved	
site within the urinary tract [488, 489]. For example, pyuria in a	
patient with an indwelling bladder catheter cannot differentiate	
Candida infection from colonization. Similarly, the colony

on 11 August 2018	
count in the urine, especially when a catheter is present, cannot	
be used to deﬁne infection [488, 489]. Imaging of the urinary	
tract by ultrasound or CT scanning is helpful in deﬁning structural abnormalities, hydronephrosis, abscesses, emphysematous	
pyelonephritis, and fungus ball formation [490–492]. Aggregation of mycelia and yeasts (fungus balls) in bladder or kidney	
leads to obstruction and precludes successful treatment of infection with antifungal agents alone [94]. Rarely, Candida species	
cause localized infections in prostate, epididymis, or testicles	
[491, 493–495].	
Several basic principles are important in the approach to	
treatment of Candida UTI. The ability of the antifungal agent	
to achieve adequate concentrations in the urine is as important	
as the antifungal susceptibilities of the infecting species [94].	
Candida albicans, the most common cause of fungal UTI, is relatively easy to treat because it is susceptible to ﬂuconazole,	
which achieves high concentrations in the urine. In contrast,	
UTIs due to ﬂuconazole-resistant C. glabrata and C. krusei	
can be extremely difﬁcult to treat.	
Fluconazole is the drug of choice for treating Candida UTI. It	
was shown to be effective in eradicating candiduria in the only	
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that has	
been conducted in patients with candiduria [496]. It is important to note that the patients in this trial were asymptomatic or	
had minimal symptoms of cystitis. Fluconazole is available as an	
oral formulation, is excreted into the urine in its active form,	
and easily achieves urine levels exceeding the MIC for most	
Candida isolates [94].	
Flucytosine demonstrates good activity against many Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei, and is excreted as	
active drug in the urine [94]. Treatment with ﬂucytosine is limited by its toxicity and the development of resistance when it is	
used as a single agent.	
AmB deoxycholate is active against most Candida species (although some C. krusei isolates are resistant) and achieves concentrations in the urine that exceed the MICs for most isolates,	
and even low doses have been shown to be effective in treating	
Candida UTI [497]. The major drawbacks are the need for intravenous administration and toxicity. The lipid formulations of	
AmB appear to not achieve urine concentrations that are adequate to treat UTI and should not be used [498].	
All other antifungal drugs, including the other azole agents	
and echinocandins, have minimal excretion of active drug	
into the urine and generally are ineffective in treating Candida	
UTI [94]. However, there are several reports of patients in	
whom echinocandins were used, primarily because of UTI	
due to ﬂuconazole-resistant organisms, and both success and	
failure were reported [499–502]. Infection localized to the kidney, as occurs with hematogenous spread, probably can be	
treated with echinocandins because tissue concentrations are	
adequate even though these agents do not achieve adequate	
urine concentrations [499].	
Irrigation of the bladder with AmB deoxycholate resolves candiduria in 80%–90% of patients, as shown in several open-label	
trials, but in those studies, recurrent candiduria within several	
weeks was very common [503–505]. This approach is useful	
only for bladder infections and generally is discouraged, especially	
in patients who would not require an indwelling catheter for any	
other reason [94,506, 507].Cystitis due to C. glabrata or C. krusei	
can sometimes be treated with amphotericin B bladder irrigation	
and endoscopic removal of any obstructing lesions [94].	
What Is the Treatment for Candida Urinary Tract Infection	
Associated With Fungus Balls?	
Recommendations	
112. Surgical intervention is strongly recommended in adults	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
113. Antifungal treatment as noted above for cystitis or pyelonephritis is recommended (strong recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
114. Irrigation through nephrostomy tubes, if present, with	
AmB deoxycholate, 25–50 mg in 200–500 mL sterile water,	
is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality	
evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Fungus balls are an uncommon complication of Candida UTI	
except in neonates, in whom fungus ball formation in the collecting system commonly occurs as a manifestation of disseminated candidiasis [483]. In adults, surgical or endoscopic	
removal of the obstructing mycelial mass is central to successful	
treatment [94, 508, 509]. In neonates, some series documented	
resolution of fungus balls with antifungal treatment alone [510],	
but others found that endoscopic removal was necessary [511,	
512].There are anecdotal reports of a variety of techniques used	
to remove fungus balls from the renal pelvis; these include endoscopic removal via a percutaneous nephrostomy tube, infusion of streptokinase locally, and irrigation with antifungal	
agents through a nephrostomy tube [511–513]. Fungus balls	
in the bladder and lower ureter usually can be removed endoscopically [509].	
XV. What Is the Treatment for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis?	
Recommendations	
115. For the treatment of uncomplicated Candida vulvovaginitis, topical antifungal agents, with no one agent superior to	
another, are recommended (strong recommendation; highquality evidence).	
116. Alternatively, for the treatment of uncomplicated Candida vulvovaginitis, a single 150-mg oral dose of ﬂuconazole is	
recommended	
(strong	
recommendation;	
high-quality	
evidence).	
117. For severe acute Candida vulvovaginitis, ﬂuconazole 150	
mg, given every 72 hours for a total of 2 or 3 doses, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

118. For C. glabrata vulvovaginitis that is unresponsive to oral	
azoles, topical intravaginal boric acid, administered in a gelatin capsule, 600 mg daily, for 14 days is an alternative	
(strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
119. Another alternative agent for C. glabrata infection is nystatin intravaginal suppositories, 100 000 units daily for 14	
days (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).	
120. A third option for C. glabrata infection is topical 17% ﬂucytosine cream alone or in combination with 3% AmB cream	
administered daily for 14 days (weak recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
121. For recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of	
induction therapy with a topical agent or oral ﬂuconazole, followed by ﬂuconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classiﬁed as either uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated,	
which accounts for only about 10% of cases, on the basis of clinical presentation, microbiological ﬁndings, host factors, and response to therapy [514]. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis	
is deﬁned as severe or recurrent disease, infection due to nonalbicans species, and/or infection in an abnormal host. Candida	
albicans is the usual pathogen, but other Candida species can	
also cause this infection.	
A diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis can usually be made	
clinically when a woman presents with symptoms of pruritus,	
irritation, vaginal soreness, external dysuria, and dyspareunia,	
often accompanied by a change in vaginal discharge. Signs include vulvar edema, erythema, excoriation, ﬁssures, and a white,	
thick, curdlike vaginal discharge. Unfortunately, these symptoms and signs are nonspeciﬁc and can be the result of a variety	
of infectious and noninfectious etiologies. Before proceeding	
with empiric antifungal therapy, the diagnosis should be conﬁrmed by a wet-mount preparation with use of saline and	
10% potassium hydroxide to demonstrate the presence of	
yeast or hyphae and a normal pH (4.0–4.5). For those with negative ﬁndings, vaginal cultures for Candida should be obtained.	
A variety of topical and systemic oral agents are available for	
treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. No evidence exists to	
show the superiority of any one topical regimen [515, 516],	
and oral and topical antifungal formulations have been shown	
to achieve entirely equivalent results [517]. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose ﬂuconazole or short-course ﬂuconazole for 3 days, both of which	
achieve >90% response [517, 518]. Treatment of vulvovaginal	
candidiasis should not differ on the basis of human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infection status; identical response rates are	
anticipated for HIV-positive and HIV-negative women.	
Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires that therapy	
be administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7	
days or orally with ﬂuconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3	
doses [54, 514]. Most Candida species, with the exception of	
C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral ﬂuconazole. Candida	
krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents. However, treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic	
[514, 516]. The most important decision to make is whether	
the presence of C. glabrata in vaginal cultures reﬂects colonization in a patient who has another disease, or whether it indicates	
true infection requiring treatment. Azole therapy, including	
voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful [519]. A variety of	
local regimens have sometimes proved effective. These include	
boric acid contained in gelatin capsules and nystatin intravaginal suppositories [520]. Topical 17% ﬂucytosine cream can be	
used alone or in combination with 3% AmB cream in recalcitrant cases [520, 521]. These topical formulations, as well as	
boric acid gelatin capsules, must be compounded by a pharmacist	
for speciﬁc patient use. Azole-resistant C. albicans infections are	
extremely rare. However, recent evidence has emerged documenting ﬂuconazole and azole class resistance in women following prolonged azole exposure [522].	
Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, deﬁned as ≥4 episodes of	
symptomatic infection within one year, is usually caused by	
azole-susceptible C. albicans [514, 523]. Contributing factors,	
such as diabetes, are rarely found. Treatment should begin	
with induction therapy with a topical agent or oral ﬂuconazole	
for 10–14 days, followed by a maintenance azole regimen for at	
least 6 months [523–525]. The most convenient and welltolerated regimen is 150 mg ﬂuconazole once weekly. This regimen achieves control of symptoms in >90% of patients [523].	
After cessation of maintenance therapy, a 40%–50% recurrence	
rate can be anticipated. If ﬂuconazole therapy is not feasible,	
topical clotrimazole cream, 200 mg twice weekly, clotrimazole	
vaginal suppository 500 mg once weekly, or other intermittent	
oral or topical antifungal treatment is recommended [526, 527].	
XVI. What Is the Treatment for Oropharyngeal Candidiasis?	
Recommendations	
122. For mild disease, clotrimazole troches, 10 mg 5 times	
daily, OR miconazole mucoadhesive buccal 50 mg tablet applied to the mucosal surface over the canine fossa once daily	
for 7–14 days, are recommended (strong recommendation;	
high-quality evidence).	
123. Alternatives for mild disease include nystatin suspension	
(100 000 U/mL) 4–6 mL 4 times daily, OR 1–2 nystatin pastilles (200 000 U each) 4 times daily, for 7–14 days (strong	
recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
124. For moderate to severe disease, oral ﬂuconazole, 100–200	
mg daily, for 7–14 days is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
125. For ﬂuconazole-refractory disease, itraconazole solution,

are recommended (strong recommendation; moderate-quality	
evidence).	
126. Alternatives for ﬂuconazole-refractory disease include	
voriconazole, 200 mg twice daily, OR AmB deoxycholate

dose, then 50 mg daily; micafungin: 100 mg daily; or anidulafungin: 200-mg loading dose, then 100 mg daily) OR intravenous AmB deoxycholate, 0.3 mg/kg daily, are other	
alternatives for refractory disease (weak recommendation;	
moderate-quality evidence).	
128. Chronic suppressive therapy is usually unnecessary. If required for patients who have recurrent infection, ﬂuconazole,	
100 mg 3 times weekly, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
129. For HIV-infected patients, antiretroviral therapy is	
strongly recommended to reduce the incidence of recurrent	
infections (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
130. For denture-related candidiasis, disinfection of the denture, in addition to antifungal therapy, is recommended	
(strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis occur in association	
with HIV infection, diabetes, leukemia and other malignancies,	
steroid use, radiation therapy, antimicrobial therapy, and denture use [528, 529], and their occurrence is recognized as an indicator of immune dysfunction. In HIV-infected patients,	
oropharyngeal candidiasis is most often observed in patients	
with CD4 counts <200 cells/µL [528–530]. The advent of effective antiretroviral therapy has led to a dramatic decline in the	
prevalence of oropharyngeal candidiasis and a marked diminution in cases of refractory disease [531].	
Fluconazole or multiazole resistance is predominantly the	
consequence of previous repeated and long-term exposure to	
ﬂuconazole or other azoles [530–533]. Especially in patients	
with advanced immunosuppression and low CD4 counts, C. albicans resistance has been described, as has gradual emergence	
of non-albicans Candida species, particularly C. glabrata, as a	
cause of refractory mucosal candidiasis [532, 533].	
Most cases of oropharyngeal candidiasis are caused by C. albicans, either alone or in mixed infections. Symptomatic infections caused by C. glabrata, C. dubliniensis, and C. krusei alone	
have been described [532–534]. Multiple randomized prospective studies of oropharyngeal candidiasis have been performed	
involving patients with AIDS and patients with cancer. Most	
patients will respond initially to topical therapy [532, 535,	
536]. In HIV-infected patients, symptomatic relapses occur	
sooner and more frequently with topical therapy than with ﬂuconazole [535].In a multicenter randomized study among HIVinfected individuals, 50-mg mucoadhesive buccal tablets of	
miconazole applied once daily to the mucosal surface over the	
canine fossa were as effective as 10-mg clotrimazole troches	
used 5 times daily [537].	
Fluconazole tablets and itraconazole solution are superior to	
ketoconazole and itraconazole capsules [538–540]. Local effects	
of oral solutions may be as important as the systemic effects.	
Posaconazole suspension is also as efﬁcacious as ﬂuconazole	
in patients with AIDS [541]. Posaconazole, 100-mg delayed release tablets, given as 300 mg daily as a single dose, are FDA approved for the prophylaxis of fungal infections in high-risk	
patients. The tablets provide a stable bioavailability (approximately 55%), once-daily dosing, and the convenience of less	
stringent food requirements for absorption. This formulation	
has not been fully evaluated for mucosal candidiasis, but, with	
further study, could replace the oral suspension for this purpose.	
Recurrent infections typically occur in patients who have persistent immunosuppression, especially those who have AIDS	
and low CD4 cell counts (<50 cells/µL) [530–533]. Long-term	
suppressive therapy with ﬂuconazole has been shown to be effective in the prevention of oropharyngeal candidiasis [53, 542,	
543]. In a large multicenter study of HIV-infected patients,	
long-term suppressive therapy with ﬂuconazole was compared	
with the episodic use of ﬂuconazole in response to symptomatic	
disease. Continuous suppressive therapy reduced the relapse	
rate more effectively than did intermittent therapy, but was associated with increased in vitro resistance. The frequency of refractory disease was the same for both groups [53]. Oral AmB	
deoxycholate, nystatin solution, and itraconazole capsules are	
less effective than ﬂuconazole in preventing oropharyngeal candidiasis [544, 545].	
Fluconazole-refractory infections should be treated initially	
with itraconazole solution; between 64% and 80% of patients	
will respond to this therapy [546, 547]. Posaconazole suspension	
is efﬁcacious in approximately 75% of patients with refractory	
oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis [548], and voriconazole	
also is efﬁcacious for ﬂuconazole-refractory infections [549]. Intravenous caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin have been	
shown to be effective alternatives to azole agents for refractory	
candidiasis [24, 87, 88, 550].Oral or intravenous AmB deoxycholate is also effective in some patients; however, a pharmacist must	
compound the oral formulation [551]. Immunomodulation with	
adjunctive granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or	
interferon-γ have been occasionally used in the management of	
refractory oral and esophageal candidiasis [552, 553].	
Decreasing rates of oral carriage of Candida species and a reduced frequency of symptomatic oropharyngeal candidiasis are	
seen among HIV-infected patients on effective antiretroviral	
therapy [554]. Thus, antiretroviral therapy should be used	
whenever possible for HIV-infected patients with oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis.

mucocutaneous lesions due to Candida species. Some patients	
have a thymoma or autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 [555]. Fluconazole should be used as initial therapy for candidiasis in these patients. Response to antifungal	
therapy may be delayed when there is extensive skin or nail involvement. Because of the intrinsic immunodeﬁciency, most	
patients require chronic suppressive antifungal therapy and frequently develop azole-refractory infections [556]. Patients with	
ﬂuconazole-refractory Candida infections should be treated the	
same as patients with AIDS who develop azole refractory infections [528].	
XVII. What Is the Treatment for Esophageal Candidiasis?	
Recommendations	
131. Systemic antifungal therapy is always required. A diagnostic trial of antifungal therapy is appropriate before	
performing an endoscopic examination (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
132. Oral ﬂuconazole, 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily, for 14–	
21 days is recommended (strong recommendation; highquality evidence).	
133. For patients who cannot tolerate oral therapy, intravenous	
ﬂuconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, OR an echinocandin	
(micafungin: 150 mg daily; caspofungin: 70-mg loading	
dose, then 50 mg daily; or anidulafungin: 200 mg daily) is	
recommended	
(strong	
recommendation;	
high-quality	
evidence).	
134. A less preferred alternative for those who cannot tolerate	
oral therapy is AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.7 mg/kg daily	
(strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).	
135. Consider de-escalating to oral therapy with ﬂuconazole	
200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily once the patient is able to tolerate oral intake (strong recommendation; moderate-quality	
evidence).	
136. For ﬂuconazole-refractory disease, itraconazole solution,	
200 mg daily, OR voriconazole, 200 mg (3 mg/kg) twice	
daily either intravenous or oral, for 14–21 days is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
137. Alternatives for ﬂuconazole-refractory disease include an	
echinocandin (micafungin: 150 mg daily; caspofungin: 70mg loading dose, then 50 mg daily; or anidulafungin: 200	
mg daily) for 14–21 days, OR AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.7	
mg/kg daily, for 21 days (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
138. Posaconazole suspension, 400 mg twice daily, or extended-release tablets, 300 mg once daily, could be considered for	
ﬂuconazole-refractory disease (weak recommendation; lowquality evidence).	
139. For patients who have recurrent esophagitis, chronic suppressive therapy with ﬂuconazole, 100–200 mg 3 times weekly, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality	
evidence).	
140. For HIV-infected patients, antiretroviral therapy is	
strongly recommended to reduce the incidence of recurrent	
infections (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).	
Evidence Summary	
Esophageal candidiasis typically occurs at lower CD4 counts	
than oropharyngeal disease [528–530]. The advent of effective	
antiretroviral therapy has led to a dramatic decline in the prevalence of esophageal candidiasis and a marked diminution in	
cases of refractory disease [531]. Most cases of esophageal	
candidiasis are caused by C. albicans. However, symptomatic	
infections caused by C. glabrata, C. dubliniensis, and C. krusei	
have been described [534].	
The presence of oropharyngeal candidiasis and dysphagia or	
odynophagia in an immunocompromised host is frequently	
predictive of esophageal candidiasis, although esophageal candidiasis can present as odynophagia without concomitant oropharyngeal candidiasis. A therapeutic trial with ﬂuconazole	
for patients with presumed esophageal candidiasis is a costeffective alternative to endoscopic examination. In general,	
most patients with esophageal candidiasis will have improvement or resolution of their symptoms within 7 days after the	
initiation of antifungal therapy [557].	
Fluconazole is superior to ketoconazole, itraconazole capsules, and ﬂucytosine, and is comparable to itraconazole solution for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis [558, 559]; up	
to 80% of patients with ﬂuconazole-refractory infections will respond to itraconazole solution [547]. Voriconazole is as efﬁcacious as ﬂuconazole and has shown success in the treatment of	
ﬂuconazole-refractory mucosal candidiasis [63, 549].	
The echinocandins are as effective as ﬂuconazole but are associated with higher relapse rates than those observed with ﬂuconazole [24, 87, 88, 550]. Thus, higher doses of echinocandins	
are recommended for use for esophageal disease than are used	
for candidemia to decrease relapses. Higher doses have been	
studied for micafungin [560]. Fluconazole-refractory disease responds to caspofungin, and it is likely that micafungin and anidulafungin are as effective as caspofungin. In patients with	
advanced AIDS, recurrent infections are common, and longterm suppressive therapy with ﬂuconazole is effective in decreasing the recurrence rates [53]. The use of effective antiretroviral therapy has dramatically decreased the incidence of	
esophageal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients.

Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hepatic glucose production are regulated according to a circadian	
rhythm. An early morning increase in FBG levels, which is pronounced among diabetic patients, is	
known as the dawn phenomenon. Although the intracellular circadian clock generates various	
molecular rhythms, whether the hepatic clock is involved in FBG rhythm remains unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of phase shift and disruption of the hepatic clock on the	
FBG rhythm. In both C57BL/6J and diabetic ob/ob mice, FBG exhibited significant daily rhythms with	
a peak at the beginning of the dark phase. Light-phase restricted feeding altered the phase of FBG	
rhythm mildly in C57BL/6J mice and greatly in ob/ob mice, in concert with the phase shifts of mRNA	
expression rhythms of the clock and glucose production–related genes in the liver. Moreover, the	
rhythmicity of FBG and Glut2 expression was not detected in liver-specific Bmal1-deficient mice.	
Furthermore, treatment with octreotide suppressed the plasma growth hormone concentration	
butdidnotaffectthehepaticmRNAexpressionoftheclockgenesortheriseinFBGduringthelatter	
half of the resting phase in C57BL/6J mice. These results suggest that the hepatic circadian clock	
plays a critical role in regulating the daily FBG rhythm, including the dawn phenomenon.	
(Endocrinology 157: 463–469, 2016)	
A	
n early morning increase in fasting blood glucose	
(FBG) levels and/or insulin requirements is known as	
the dawn phenomenon (1). This phenomenon is pronounced among type 1 diabetic patients (1), but the condition occurs also in those with type 2 diabetes (2, 3) and	
in nondiabetic subjects (4). Clinical studies in the 1980s	
using pharmacological inhibition suggested that GH, but	
not cortisol, is responsible for the dawn phenomenon (5–	
7). Another study revealed that nocturnal surges in GH	
cause an increased rate of hepatic glucose production during the early morning hours by decreasing hepatic insulin	
sensitivity (8).	
In patients with type 2 diabetes, hepatic glucose production exhibits circadian rhythmicity, which causes daily	
variation in insulin sensitivity (9). In animals, hepatic gluconeogenesis is increased at the beginning of the active	
phase, consistent with elevated activity of the rate-controlling enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (10,	
11). In addition, transcripts of numerous components related to glucose metabolism, including glucose 6-phosphatase and glucose transporter type 2, are expressed with	
a circadian rhythm in the liver (12). Furthermore, a subset	
of the clock genes that constitute the intracellular circadian pacemaker are reported to mediate gluconeogenesis	
and glucose export in hepatocytes (13, 14). Collectively,	
these findings suggest that a hepatic circadian clock mediates	
the	
circadian	
regulation	
of	
hepatic	
glucose	
production.	
Consistent with the rhythm of hepatic glucose production, basal (fasting) blood glucose exhibits an obvious	
daily rhythm in rats with a peak at the beginning of the	
active phase (15). The rhythm appears to be regulated by	
the central clock residing in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus because FBG does not exhibit daily variISSN Print 0013-7227

ation in suprachiasmatic nucleus–lesioned rats (15). However,whetherthehepaticcircadianclockdirectlyregulates	
the daily FBG rhythm and the dawn phenomenon remains	
unclear. Peripheral circadian clocks, including the hepatic	
clock, are controlled by the central clock, which is reset	
mainly by light, whereas the hepatic clock rhythm is affected more by feeding (16, 17). Therefore, elucidating the	
roles of feeding and the hepatic clock in the dawn phenomenon is important and would be clinically useful. In	
the present study, we found that the daily FBG rhythms in	
normal and diabetic mice are influenced by feeding time	
and that the dawn phenomenon is observed in GH-suppressed mice but not in liver-specific circadian clock–disrupted mice.	
Materials and Methods	
Animals	
The protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional	
Animal Experiment Committee of Jichi Medical University. All	
animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Institutional Regulation for Animal Experiments and Fundamental Guideline for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and	
Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the	
jurisdiction of the MEXT of Japan. All efforts were made to	
minimize animal suffering.	
Six-week-old male C57BL/6J and B6.V-Lepob/J (ob/ob) mice	
were obtained from Charles River Japan. C57BL/6J-background,liver-specificBmal1-deficient(L-Bmal1/)andcontrol	
(flox/flox) mice (18) homozygous for floxed Bmal1, with and	
without Cre driven by the albumin promoter, respectively, were	
bred and raised at the Center for Experimental Medicine of Jichi	
Medical University. All mice were maintained under specific	
pathogen-free conditions and controlled temperature and humidity with a 12:12-hour light/dark cycle and fed a regular diet	
(CE-2; CLEA Japan) and water ad libitum.	
Experiments	
Only male mice were used in this study. Zeitgeber time (ZT)	
was used to describe the experimental time with ZT 0 defined as	
lights on and ZT 12 as lights off. To reduce the number of mice,	
a crossover design was used in experiments 1 and 3 as described	
below.	
Experiment 1	
Twelve-week-oldC57BL/6Jandob/obmice(eachn9)were	
fastedfor24hoursfromZT0orZT12(n4and5,respectively,	
for each strain). At 15 weeks of age, the mice were fasted again	
for 24 hours from the other ZT. Glucose concentrations in the	
blood(takenfromthetail)weremeasuredevery6hoursthroughout the fasting period using a Glutest Ace R (Sanwa Kagaku	
Kenkyusyo).	
Experiment 2	
Twenty-four C57BL/6J mice were divided into 2 groups at 10	
weeks of age. Half of the mice were given food only during the	
light phase (from ZT 0 to ZT 12) and the other half were fed ad	
libitum. After 14 days, the mice were fasted from ZT 12 and then	
killedtoobtainliversamplesatZT18,0,6,and12.Othergroups	
of 10-week-old C57BL/6J (n  9) and ob/ob mice (n  5) were	
also subjected to the same 2-week time-restricted feeding regimen and then fasted for 24 hours from ZT 12 to investigate daily	
FBG profiles.	
Experiment 3	
Twelve- to 14-week-old L-Bmal1/ (n  17) and control	
(flox/flox) mice (n  15) were fasted from ZT 12 and then killed	
toobtainliversamplesatZT18,0,6,and12.Toinvestigatedaily

Statistical analyses	
Data are presented as means and SD. Differences between 2

significance.	
Results	
In this study, we defined FBG as a	
blood glucose level 6 hours or longer	
after the start of fasting. When fasting was started at the beginning of	
the light phase, FBG levels increased	
slightly during the light phase and	
then decreased significantly during	
the dark phase in C57BL/6J mice	
(Figure 1A). In contrast, when fasting was started at the beginning of	
the dark phase, FBG levels decreased	
during the dark phase and continued	
to increase during the following light	
phase (Figure 1B). In addition, we	
conducted same experiments using	
obese diabetic ob/ob mice, because	
they have severe insulin resistance	
with marked hyperinsulinemia and	
therefore exhibit large fluctuations	
in	
blood	
glucose	
concentrations	
(20).	
As	
expected,	
ob/ob	
mice	
showed	
similar,	
but	
more	
pronounced, daily changes in FBG (Figure 1, D and E), than C57BL/6J mice.	
In both mouse strains, maximal levels of FBG were observed at the beginning of the dark phase (ie, at	
“dawn” for the nocturnal animals),	
regardless of the starting time of	
fasting.	
To examine the involvement of	
the hepatic clock in the dawn phenomenon,	
we	
first	
investigated

glucose production–related genes (B) in the liver of C57BL/6J mice. The intervention group (E)	
was given food only during the light phase for 2 weeks, whereas the control group (F) was fed	
ad libitum. These mice were fasted from ZT 12 and then killed to obtain liver samples at ZT 18, 0,	
6, and 12. The data obtained by real-time PCR were analyzed using the comparative threshold	
cycle method. Because the Rplp0 mRNA levels in the mice liver were not rhythmic (19), this gene	
was used as an endogenous control. Data represent the means and SD of 3 mice per time point

whether time-restricted feeding influences not only the hepatic clock but also the FBG rhythm. As shown in Figure	
2A, 2-week restriction of food intake to the light (resting)	
phase greatly shifted the oscillation phase of hepatic	
mRNA expression of all of the clock genes examined in	
C57BL/6J mice under a ZT 12–started fasting condition.	
In addition, this feeding condition appeared to affect the	
mRNA expression rhythms of the glucose production–	
related molecules, although the rhythmicity of the genes	
other than Glut2 was not statistically significant probably	
due to the small number of animals (Figure 2B). FBG	
dropped to lower levels during the latter half of the light	
phase in time-restricted–fed mice (Figure 1C), in contrast	
to the result in control mice (Figure 1B). Moreover, in	
ob/ob mice, the acrophase was obviously shifted from the	
beginning of the dark phase (Figure 1E) to the beginning	
of the light phase (Figure 1F).	
Next, we investigated the daily FBG rhythm in mice	
with liver-specific deletion of brain	
and	
muscle	
Arnt-like	
protein-1	
(BMAL1), the core and essential	
component of the intracellular circadian clock (21). As expected, this deletion did not influence the daily	
feeding rhythm (Supplemental Figure 1) but significantly affected the	
rhythmic mRNA expression of the	
clock genes, especially Bmal1 and	
Dbp, in the liver of mice even under	
a ZT 12–started fasting condition	
(Figure 3A). Moreover, consistent	
with previous results in fed mice	
(13), daily Glut2 rhythm disappeared in L-Bmal1/ mice (Figure	
3B). Similar to C57BL/6J mice (Figure 1, A and B), control (flox/flox)	
mice exhibited significant fluctuations in FBG in both ZT 0–started	
and ZT 12–started fasting trials (Figure	
4,	
A	
and	
B).	
Conversely,	
L-Bmal1/ mice did not generate	
any 24-hour rhythmicity in FBG	
(Figure 4, A and B). These results	
clearly suggest that the hepatic clock	
is involved in the daily FBG rhythm.	
Because nocturnal secretion of	
GH is thought to cause the dawn	
phenomenon in humans (6, 8), we	
further investigated the effect of octreotide-suppressed GH on elevated	
FBG	
levels	
in	
C57BL/6J	
mice.	
Plasma GH concentrations were	
suppressedsubstantially24hoursafter the octreotide administration at	
ZT 12 (Supplemental Figure 2).	
Conversely, hepatic mRNA expression of the clock and glucose production-related genes was not affected	
by this treatment (Supplemental Table2).Bloodglucoselevelsdecreased

after the start of fasting and the injection in both octreotide- and vehicle-treated mice (data not shown). In the	
control group, FBG levels significantly increased from ZT	
6 to ZT 12 (Supplemental Figure 3A), similar to those in	
nontreated mice (Figure 1A). Notably, FBG concentrations were also elevated at the beginning of the active	
phaseinallthemicetreatedwithoctreotide(Supplemental	
Figure 3B). Thus, the dawn phenomenon in the present	
model was detected even under the GH-suppressed	
condition.	
Discussion	
Consistent with previous findings in rats (15), basal blood	
glucose exhibited daily rhythmicity with a peak at the beginning of the active phase using the simple mouse model	
used in this study. In this model, mice were fasted for 24	
hours, but no mice exhibited severe hypoglycemia (blood	
glucose level of 3.0 mmol/L) throughout the experiments. Specifically, the FBG trough levels in ob/ob mice	
were 7 mmol/L. Therefore, posthypoglycemic hyperglycemia was probably not involved in increased blood glucose levels in this model. Conversely, the hepatic intracellular clock may play a role in the fluctuation of FBG	
because L-Bmal1/ mice did not exhibit such rhythmicity. Previous (13, 18) and present studies (Supplemental	
Figure 1) showed that L-Bmal1/ mice exhibit normal	
circadian rhythmicity of both locomotor activity and feeding behavior, suggesting that the function of the central	
clock is intact. Thus, the present study provides further	
evidence of the crucial role of the hepatic clock in regulating glucose metabolism.	
In humans, the dawn phenomenon is caused by increased hepatic glucose production during the early morning hours (8). In this study, elevated FBG levels were observed at the beginning of the active phase in both normal	
and diabetic mice fed ad libitum. In addition, the rising	
phase of FBG was shifted by the time-restricted feeding	
procedure, consistent with the alteration of mRNA expression rhythmicity of the glucose production-related	
molecules. Furthermore, in L-Bmal1/ mice, the temporary increase in FBG levels disappeared, in concert with	
thedisruptedexpressionrhythmicityofGLUT2,themajor	
glucose transporter of hepatocytes. Based on these results,	
elevatedbloodglucoselevelsobservedinthismousemodel	
were considered the dawn phenomenon. Interestingly, the	
influence of the time-restricted feeding on FBG rhythm	
was mild in normal mice, compared with that in diabetic	
mice (Figure 1). This may suggest that some factors such	
as insulin sensitivity in the muscle and adipose tissues	
modify the FBG rhythm driven by the hepatic clock.	
In patients with type 1 diabetes, suppression of nocturnal spikes of GH secretion by somatostatin results in the	
disappearance of the dawn phenomenon (6, 8). In contrast, in the present study, treatment with a somatostatin	
analog did not inhibit the rise of glucose levels in male	
mice. Reportedly, GH levels are higher during the light	
phase than during the dark phase in female mice, but similardailyrhythmicitycannotbedetectedinmalemice(22).	
Collectively, these findings suggest that the dawn phenomenon occurs even in the absence of GH surges during	
the resting phase, at least in male mice. Nevertheless, because somatostatin suppresses not only GH secretion but

habits could possibly affect the dawn phenomenon in humans, especially in diabetic patients. Studies on mice have	
shown that the hepatic clock phase is affected by both the	
amount of food and the interval between feeding time	
points (24). In addition, food composition determines the	
degree of food entrainment of the hepatic clock (25).

which detects the dawn phenomenon even in patients with

In conclusion, FBG exhibited an obvious 24-hour	
rhythm with a peak near the beginning of the active phase	
in mice. This rhythm, including the temporal rise corresponding to the dawn phenomenon, was altered in concert	
with the phase shift of the hepatic clock in time-restricted	
feeding mice and was not detected in liver-specific clockdisrupted mice. Because these results suggest that the hepatic clock plays a critical role in generating rhythmicity of	
basal blood glucose, further clinical studies are needed to	
explore the relationship in diabetic patients.

SUMMARY	
Although Candida albicans is the main cause of fungal esophagitis, other species such as C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. 	
stellatoidea have also been implicated. Several studies have identified risk factors for C. albicans esophagitis. However, data for 	
non-C. albicans species is still sparse. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of Candida esophagitis in our medical 	
centre over an 18-month period. Additionally, we aimed to investigate predisposing conditions for esophageal candidosis caused by 	
different Candida species. A total of 21,248 upper gastroscopies were performed in Santa Casa Complexo Hospitalar between January 	
2005 and July 2006. The prevalence of Candida esophagitis was 0.74% (n = 158). C. albicans caused the vast majority of infections 	
(96.2%), followed by C. tropicalis (2.5%), C. lusitaniae (0.6%) and C. glabrata (0.6%). There were 81 women (51.3%) and 77 men 	
(48.7%). No case of mixed infection occurred. Concomitant oral candidosis was documented for 10.8% (n = 17). Most of cases 	
(55.1%) involved outpatients. Around one fifth of patients in our cohort had no identifiable risk factors for esophageal candidosis 	
(20.8%). Since nearly all infections were caused by C. albicans we were not able to determine risk factors for esophagitis caused by 	
other Candida species.

INTRODUCTION	
Candida species are the most common agents of fungal esophagitis. 	
While this is usually caused by C. albicans21, other species such as C. 	
tropicalis, C. krusei and C. stellatoidea have also been involved16. Risk 	
factors for Candida esophagitis have been documented in several series. 	
These include pharmacological suppression of gastric acid production1,2,13, 	
use of antibiotics24,28, previous vagotomy4,7,8, functional or mechanical 	
esophageal abnormalities28,30, and endocrine diseases such as diabetes 	
mellitus, hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism11,18. Malnutrition, 	
alcoholism, advanced age26,27,28, and therapy with corticosteroids - either 	
systemic or inhaled - has also been implicated2,22. However, there are very 	
limited data from Brazilian patients. In addition, very little is known for 	
infections caused by species other than C. albicans. This study aims to 	
document the species distribution in patients with Candida esophagitis 	
over an 18-month period (2005-2006) in a single medical centre. We were 	
particularly interested in the comparison of risk factors for esophageal 	
candidosis amongst patients infected by different Candida species.	
MATERIAL AND METHODS	
This study was performed between January 2005 and July 2006 	
at Santa Casa Complexo Hospitalar, an university tertiary hospital 	
with 1,200 beds located in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil. Esophageal 	
candidosis was defined by the recovery of Candida species from either 	
esophageal brushing or a biopsy of the esophagus performed during 	
upper gastroscopy. Esophageal candidosis was endoscopically confirmed 	
in the presence of typical sparse or coalescent white plates covering the 	
esophageal mucosa. Only cases of endoscopically-confirmed Candida 	
esophagitis were included, so patients considered to be only colonized 	
by Candida species were excluded. Since this was a retrospective study, 	
neither clinical symptoms nor reason for performing endoscopy was 	
evaluated. All samples obtained endoscopically were sent in saline 	
solution to the Mycology laboratory. The germ tube test was used to 	
differentiate C. albicans from other Candida species, which were in turn 	
identified with ID 32C (bioMérieux Marcy l’Étoile, France).	
Medical records of patients with Candida esophagitis, were reviewed 	
to identify potential risk factors for the infections, presented in the 30 days 	
preceding the endoscopic procedure. Chronic therapy with corticosteroids 	
was considered when patients were in use of 20 mg of prednisone of 	
equivalent for >14 days.	
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software. Categorical 	
variables were compared using the chi-square and the Fisher’s exact 	
tests, and p values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The 	
study received ethical approval by the hospital’s research ethic board 	
(protocol number1000/05).

RESULTS	
During the period of study 21,248 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies 	
were performed in our medical centre. The prevalence of fungal 	
esophagitis was 0.8% (n = 163). Five patients were excluded - four 	
due to lack of clinical data and one because the infection was caused 	
by Saccharomyces cerevisae. The vast majority of infections for the 	
remaining 158 patients were caused by C. albicans (96.2%), followed by 	
C. tropicalis (2.5%), C. lusitaniae (0.6%) and C. glabrata (0.6%). There 	
were 81 women (51.3%) and 77 men (48.7%). All patients were adults, 	
with ages ranging from 21-88 years old (mean 57.4; standard deviation 	
16.7 years). No case of mixed fungal infection occurred. Concomitant 	
oral candidosis was documented for 10.8% (n = 17). Most of cases 	
(55.1%) involved outpatients.	
The majority of patients (79.2%) had at least one identifiable risk 	
factor for esophageal candidosis. Median number of risk factors per 	
patient was 1.0 (range, 1-6). As shown in Table 1, no difference was 	
observed in the distribution of risk factors for esophageal candidosis 	
when Candida species were considered.	
DISCUSSION	
The prevalence of fungal esophagitis in this study involving 21,248 	
patients submitted to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was 0.77%. 	
Similar frequencies have been reported in other series14,17,25. We observed 	
in our study that virtually all cases of fungal esophagitis were caused by 	
Candida species, with one rare case due to S. cerevisae.	
Although esophageal candidosis is a common opportunistic infection 	
in patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)23, the 	
vast majority of patients in our series (93.7%) were not infected by this 	
virus. Since this was a retrospective study, the importance of this variable 	
might be underestimated. However, other authors have demonstrated a 	
marked reduction in the prevalence of esophageal candidosis in HIV 	
patients over the last decade, justified by the immunological benefit 	
obtained from antiretroviral therapy10,15,19. 	
Around one fifth of patients in our cohort had no identifiable risk 	
factors for esophageal candidosis (20.8%). It has been demonstrated 	
that esophageal candidosis can occur in healthy individuals14. Still the 	
mechanisms of infection in these patients are not clear6,16. Candida species 	
are known to colonize the esophagus of 20% of healthy adults12,22. In the 	
series by MIMIDIS et al., 36% of patients had no evident risk factor for 	
esophageal candidosis14. Interestingly, we observed that 50% of patients 	
infected by species other than C. albicans showed no evident predisposing 	
condition for the infection. Due to the limited number of patients with 	
non-C. albicans infection (n = 6), we were not able to show any difference 	
of statistical significance. The clinical or biological importance of this, 	
however, is unknown. In addition it should be noted that, due to the 	
retrospective nature of our study, some data may be missing. In particular, 	
immunological or endocrine conditions predisposing patients to chronic 	
mucocutaneous candidosis were not systematically investigated20.	
In conclusion, we found C. albicans to be the main etiology of fugal 	
esophagitis in our medical centre. Most of patients had one evident 	
predisposing condition for Candida esophagitis, and HIV infection 	
was quite uncommon. The occurrence of non-C. albicans infections 	
in patients with no obvious risk factors for these conditions deserves 	
further investigation.

MyoD, a master regulator of myogenesis, exhibits a circadian	
rhythm in its mRNA and protein levels, suggesting a possible role	
in the daily maintenance of muscle phenotype and function. We	
report that MyoD is a direct target of the circadian transcriptional	
activators CLOCK and BMAL1, which bind in a rhythmic manner to	
the core enhancer of the MyoD promoter. Skeletal muscle of	
ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mutant mice exhibited ∼30% reductions in	
normalized maximal force. A similar reduction in force was observed at the single-ﬁber level. Electron microscopy (EM) showed	
that the myoﬁlament architecture was disrupted in skeletal muscle	
of ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−mice. The alteration in myoﬁlament organization was associated with decreased expression of	
actin, myosins, titin, and several MyoD target genes. EM analysis	
also demonstrated that muscle from both ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−	
mice had a 40% reduction in mitochondrial volume. The remaining	
mitochondria in these mutant mice displayed aberrant morphology	
and increased uncoupling of respiration. This mitochondrial pathology was not seen in muscle of MyoD−/−mice. We suggest that	
altered expression of both Pgc-1α and Pgc-1β in ClockΔ19 and	
Bmal1−/−mice may underlie this pathology. Taken together, our	
results demonstrate that disruption of CLOCK or BMAL1 leads to	
structural and functional alterations at the cellular level in skeletal	
muscle. The identiﬁcation of MyoD as a clock-controlled gene provides a mechanism by which the circadian clock may generate	
a muscle-speciﬁc circadian transcriptome in an adaptive role for	
the daily maintenance of adult skeletal muscle.	
circadian clock | myoﬁlaments | mitochondria	
A	
fundamental, evolutionarily conserved property of most	
organisms, from cyanobacteria to plants and animals, is the	
daily cycling of their internal physiology as well as certain behaviors in animals, such as sleep and feeding (1). The timing of	
these circadian rhythms is synchronized to the environment by	
external cues, with light and nutrient availability being two of the	
most salient entrainment cues (2). The synchronization of endogenous circadian rhythms with the daily cycles in the environment provides an adaptive mechanism for organisms to anticipate	
cyclic demands on cellular physiology and behavior (3, 4). At the	
molecular level, the circadian clock represents a well-deﬁned gene	
regulatory network composed of transcriptional-translational	
feedback loops (5). The positive arm of the loop is composed of	
the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize and bind to E-box elements on target genes such as Per1	
to drive the negative part of the feedback loop (5). More recently,	
the same molecular clock factors that have been identiﬁed in the	
central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus have been found to	
exist in most peripheral tissues (reviewed in ref. 6).	
We recently characterized the circadian transcriptome of adult	
skeletal muscle. These mRNAs exhibit signiﬁcant oscillation in	
gene expression with a repeating period length of 24 h. One of	
the intriguing observations from the array data was the ﬁnding that	
MyoD mRNA exhibited a circadian pattern (7, 8). MyoD is a wellestablished skeletal muscle-speciﬁc transcription factor that directly	
regulates expression of the myogenic program (9). In addition to	
MyoD, we found that the core components of the molecular clock,	
including Bmal1 and Per2 expression, were oscillating as is seen	
in liver and other peripheral tissues (7). Interestingly, MyoD expression, like Per2 mRNA, did not oscillate in muscle of the	
ClockΔ19 mutant mouse, suggesting the possibility that MyoD is	
a clock-controlled gene.	
We show here that MyoD is regulated by the circadian transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1. In addition, we ﬁnd	
that skeletal muscles from either ClockΔ19 or Bmal1−/−mice exhibit signiﬁcant functional deﬁcits in contractile force, disrupted	
myoﬁlament architecture, and altered expression of MyoD target	
genes. Morphological and functional analyses show that the	
muscle of MyoD−/−mice phenocopy that seen in the ClockΔ19 and	
Bmal1−/−mice, providing evidence that suggests that MyoD may	
act as a molecular link between the circadian clock and skeletal	
muscle maintenance. The skeletal muscles of ClockΔ19 and	
Bmal1−/−, but not MyoD−/−, mice also have profound mitochondrial pathologies that were associated with altered expression of	
both Pgc-1α and Pgc-1β in the circadian mutant mice. These	
results show that a lineage-speciﬁc transcription factor, MyoD, is	
a clock-controlled gene and deﬁne the circadian factors CLOCK	
and BMAL1 as critical modulators of molecular, cellular, and	
functional parameters of skeletal muscle.	
Results	
MyoD Is a Clock-Controlled Gene. We recently reported that myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) mRNA is expressed in a circadian	
fashion in adult skeletal muscle (7). The identiﬁcation of MyoD as	
a circadian gene was of interest because MyoD is well-established	
as a master regulator of the skeletal muscle transcriptional program (9). To validate the array results, we performed quantitative

PCR analysis of MyoD mRNA from wild-type gastrocnemius	
muscles collected every 4 h for 48 h. The frequency (every 4 h)	
and duration (48 h) of sample collection was required to establish	
the 24-hr repeating oscillation pattern of circadian mRNA expression. The results are presented in Fig. 1A and conﬁrm that	
MyoD mRNA exhibits a circadian oscillation with a greater than	
twofold change in amplitude over 24 h (Fig. 1A). Analysis of	
MyoD mRNA levels in muscle from ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice	
(Fig. 1 A and B) demonstrated that the circadian oscillation in	
MyoD mRNA was abolished, similar to other known cycling genes	
such as Per2 and Dbp. Western blot analysis of whole-muscle	
extracts from wild-type mice show that MYOD protein levels	
oscillate over 24 h with the peak levels in MYOD protein lagging	
the peak mRNA levels by about 4–8 h (Fig. 1C).	
To test whether MyoD was a transcriptional target of CLOCK	
and BMAL1, we performed transcriptional reporter gene and	
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. MyoD luciferase reporter genes (CE+6.8MyoD, 6.8MyoD; Fig. 1D), which	
incorporated previously identiﬁed regulatory regions of the MyoD	
promoter; the 6.8 kb of the 5′ ﬂanking region that contained the	
distal regulatory region (DRR) plus or minus the core enhancer	
(CE) were used (10, 11). As shown in Fig. 1D, expression of	
CLOCK and BMAL1 signiﬁcantly induced expression of the Per1	
reporter ∼2.5-fold and the CE+6.8MyoD reporter approximately	
sixfold (P < 0.05). However, activation of the MyoD reporter required the CE element, as expression of BMAL1 and CLOCK did	
not activate the 6.8MyoD reporter. Full activation of the CE	
+6.8MyoD reporter required a wild-type CLOCK activator because transfection with an expression vector encoding the ClockΔ19	
mutant cDNA resulted in an about 50% reduction in MyoD promoter activity (Fig. 1D). The CE and the DRR enhancers of the	
MyoD promoter have previously been shown using enhancerspeciﬁc knockout mice to provide complementary regulation of	
MyoD expression during development and maturation (12, 13).	
ChIP assays were performed using muscle samples collected from	
mice at selected times when MyoD mRNA is lowest [circadian time	
26 (CT26)] and when MyoD mRNA is rising (CT38) to determine	
whether CLOCK and BMAL1 bind the CE or DRR of the MyoD	
promoter in adult skeletal muscle. We found that CLOCK and	
BMAL1 bind to the CE and that this binding was enriched by 12and 34-fold, respectively, at CT38 compared with CT26. In contrast, no CLOCK or BMAL1 binding was detected at the DRR,	
regardless of the time of day (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these	
results support the hypothesis that MyoD is a direct target of	
CLOCK:BMAL1 binding at the CE and thus is a primary clockcontrolled gene.	
Decreased Function and Altered Structure in Skeletal Muscle of	
Circadian Mutant and MyoD−/−Mice. We next tested whether speciﬁc tension, a measure of muscle function, was compromised in	
ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−mice compared with that of	
wild-type mice. Speciﬁc tension is the maximal isometric tetanic	
force normalized for muscle size; an example of a force trace from	
wild-type muscle is shown in Fig. 2A. The average speciﬁc tension	
(Fig. 2B) was signiﬁcantly depressed in the extensor digitorum	
longus (EDL) muscles of 12- to 14-wk-old ClockΔ19 (−29.7%),	
Bmal1−/−(−34.4%), and MyoD−/−(−33%) mice compared with	
EDL muscles from wild-type mice (P < 0.05). This decrease in	
speciﬁc tension was due to lower maximal force as we found that	
there was no difference in EDL wet mass or ﬁber length among	
the genotypes. In addition, light microscopy of toludine-blue–	
stained muscle sections indicated that there were no dramatic	
pathologies. As seen in Fig. S1, the ﬁbers from the ClockΔ19	
mutant and MyoD−/−mice did not exhibit any disease hallmarks	
such as central nuclei or signiﬁcant areas of fat or connective	
tissue inﬁltration.	
To test whether the mechanical deﬁcits could be detected at the	
single-cell level, we performed mechanics on isolated skinned ﬁber segments from EDL muscles of wild-type and Bmal1−/−mice	
(14). Similar to that seen with whole-muscle tissue, maximally	
activated speciﬁc tension (in kNm−2: force normalized for Per1	
cross-section) was signiﬁcantly lower in the ﬁber segments from	
the Bmal1−/−mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2C). To	
evaluate potential inﬂuences of calcium sensitivity, the tension	
measures at each of the calcium concentrations were normalized	
to the maximal tension for each ﬁber (Fig. 2D). We found no	
difference in the relative force:pCa (pCa = −log10 [Ca2+]) curves,	
indicating that the difference in maximal speciﬁc tension was not	
due to altered calcium ion sensitivity of the myoﬁlaments from	
Bmal1−/−mice.	
The results of single-ﬁber experiments suggest that the decrement	
in force capacity of muscle could occur at the level of myoﬁlament	
organization. We used electron microscopy (EM) to evaluate the	
myoﬁlament and sarcomeric architecture of skeletal muscle from	
wild-type, ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−mice (n = 3/genotype).

MyoD is a clock-controlled gene in skeletal muscle. (A) Expression of	
MyoD in wild type (●) and ClockΔ19 (○) muscle was determined by quantitative PCR. Samples were collected every 4 h for 48 h starting at circadian	
time 18 (CT18) through CT62. Even though all collections were performed	
under total darkness, the dark and light stripes on the graph represent	
presumptive dark and light phases of the mice. (B) The diurnal expression	
(12:00 AM vs. 12:00 PM) of MyoD in wild-type (lanes 1–4) and Bmal1−/−(lanes	
5–8) skeletal muscle was determined by semiquantitative PCR normalized to	
Rpl26 gene expression. Muscles (n = 4/group) were collected under DD at	
either 12:00 AM (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or 12:00 PM (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8).

signiﬁcantly transactivated Per1 and CE-MyoD reporter genes by ∼2.5-fold	
and 6-fold, respectively, relative to control transfections (open bar). MyoD	
reporter was not activated by BMAL1:CLOCK, and activation of CE-MyoD	
reporter was signiﬁcantly decreased by 50% when ClockΔ19 was overexpressed with BMAL1 (gray bar). Values are mean ± SEM with signiﬁcance

vealed that the highly conserved hexagonal arrangement of the thin	
and thick ﬁlaments was signiﬁcantly disrupted in muscle from the	
ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−mice (Fig. 2E). The abnormal	
geometry observed in the myoﬁlament structure of ClockΔ19,	
Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−mice was deﬁned by variation in the number	
of thin ﬁlaments associated with each thick ﬁlament, irregular thinto-thin ﬁlament spacing, and irregular thick-to-thick ﬁlament spacing. We also found that when we analyzed EM images from longitudinal sections of muscle from ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−	
mice that the registry of the sarcomeres was compromised (Fig. S2).	
Decreased Mitochondrial Volume and Depressed Respiratory Function	
of Muscles from Circadian Mutant Mice. The electron micrographs	
from the gastrocnemius muscles of the ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and	
MyoD−/−mice were also used to analyze mitochondria. From	
these micrographs we found that there was a dramatic loss	
in the number of mitochondria, especially beneath the muscle	
membrane in muscle of the ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice (Fig. 3A	
and Fig. S3). The mitochondrial volume was quantiﬁed using	
the point-counting morphometric technique as described by	
Eisenberg (15). Consistent with the images, there was a 40%	
reduction in mitochondrial volume of skeletal muscle from	
ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice (Fig. 3B). In addition to the dramatic loss of mitochondria, higher magniﬁcation revealed that	
the remaining mitochondria exhibited a pathological morphology characterized by swelling and disruption of cristae (Fig. 3C).

By contrast, skeletal muscle of MyoD−/−showed no mitochondrial phenotype (Fig. S4).	
We next isolated mitochondria from gastrocnemius and diaphragm muscles of wild-type and Bmal1−/−mice and determined	
the biochemical function and the respiratory control ratio (RCR).	
The RCR represents the ratio of state 3 to state 4 respiration and	
indicates how well coupled the biochemical processes are within the	
mitochondria. Compared with wild-type mitochondria, the RCR	
of mitochondria isolated from gastrocnemius (GTN) and diaphragm (DIA) muscles of Bmal1−/−mice was depressed 43% and	
72%, respectively (Fig. 3D). The decrease in the RCR of mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscle of Bmal1−/−was primarily	
due to a reductionin state 3 respiration as state 4 respirationwas not	
signiﬁcantly different from wild type (Fig. 3E and Fig. S5). These	
results are consistent with the EM analysis and indicate that the	
function of the surviving mitochondria in the muscles of the 12- to	
14-wk-old Bmal1−/−mice are impaired.	
Altered Expression of Pgc-1α and Pgc-1β in Circadian Mutant Skeletal	
Muscle. Because the mitochondrial pathology was not found in the	
muscle of MyoD−/−mice, we looked for potential genes that could	
link the circadian factors CLOCK and BMAL1 with mitochondrial biogenesis/function. Data from the expression proﬁling of	
the skeletal-muscle circadian transcriptome identiﬁed Pgc-1β as	
a circadian mRNA (Fig. 4A). We performed quantitative PCR	
measurements of Pgc-1β in wild-type skeletal muscle and found	
circadian mRNA expression that was damped in the muscle of	
ClockΔ19 mice (Fig. 4B). We also conﬁrmed that Pgc-1α expression, although not circadian, was signiﬁcantly down-regulated in	
skeletal muscle of ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice compared with	
wild-type mice (Fig. 4C) (7). These results show that both members of the Pgc-1 coactivator family are mis-regulated in muscle of	
both ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice.	
Discussion	
The results presented here demonstrate that the circadian factors	
CLOCK and BMAL1 are critical for skeletal-muscle function,	
structure, and mitochondrial content. Muscles from both ClockΔ19	
and Bmal1−/−mice showed profound decrements in forcegenerating capacity, signiﬁcant myoﬁlament and sarcomeric disarray, and mitochondrial pathologies. Molecular studies identiﬁed	
MyoD, the muscle-speciﬁc transcription factor, as a clockcontrolled gene under direct transcriptional control of CLOCK	
and BMAL1. Additionally, muscle from adult MyoD−/−mice	
exhibits similar functional and structural abnormalities as those	
seen in ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice, providing evidence that	
suggests that circadian regulation of MyoD may be one mechanism	
for maintaining adult skeletal muscle. However, the mitochondrial	
pathologies observed in the ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice were not	
found in the muscle of the MyoD−/−mouse. We found that both	
Pgc-1α and Pgc-1β were mis-expressed in the muscles of ClockΔ19	
and Bmal1−/−mice. From these results we suggest a working	
model, illustrated in Fig. 4D, in which the transcriptional activators	
CLOCK and BMAL1 regulate daily expression of MyoD as	
a component of a maintenance program for structure and mechanical function. In addition, we suggest that CLOCK and	
BMAL1 may regulate Pgc-1 in a parallel pathway to maintain	
mitochondrial levels. These results provide molecular, cellular,	
and physiological evidence to support the critical role of CLOCK	
and BMAL1 in adult skeletal-muscle function and metabolism.	
Circadian Rhythms, Skeletal Muscle, and MyoD. Circadian rhythms	
and the core clock factors CLOCK and BMAL1 have been implicated in a growing number of systemic pathologies, including	
metabolic disease, aging, and cardiovascular disease (16–18). To	
date, however, no genetic studies have examined what role circadian rhythms play in adult skeletal muscle. Our earlier results	
from an expression proﬁling study identiﬁed circadian expression	
of the components of the molecular clock (e.g., Bmal1, Per2) and	
showed that expression of MyoD, a master regulator of skeletal	
muscle differentiation, followed a circadian pattern (7, 8).	
MyoD is the founding member of the myogenic regulatory	
factor family of transcription factors, which includes Myf5,	
myogenin, and MRF4 (19). Although the function of MyoD in	
myogenesis is known in considerable detail, our understanding of	
its role in adult skeletal muscle remains incomplete (20). The	
deﬁcit in speciﬁc tension of MyoD−/−mice, in addition to their	
impaired regenerative ability, suggests that MyoD serves an important function in adult skeletal muscle (21, 22). The importance of MyoD function in adult skeletal muscle is further	
underscored by the observation that MyoD expression is altered	
in a number of muscular dystrophies as well as in sarcopenia, the	
age-associated loss of muscle mass (23–25). The identiﬁcation of	
MyoD as a clock-controlled gene expands the function of MyoD	
beyond its well-known role in myogenesis to include a role in the	
daily maintenance of adult skeletal muscle.	
The loss of circadian expression of MyoD in skeletal muscle	
from both ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice is very similar to what has

been previously observed with other genes known to be regulated	
by BMAL1 and CLOCK, such as Per2 and Dbp (referred to as	
clock-controlled genes) (7, 8). Results from reporter gene assays	
and ChIP experiments conﬁrmed that MyoD is a direct target of	
CLOCK and BMAL1. In particular, ChIP assays show that	
CLOCK and BMAL1 bind to the MyoD CE and not to the DRR	
of the promoter. The CE is located ≈20 kb upstream of the	
transcriptional start site, and analysis of MyoD expression in the	
CE knockout mouse revealed that the CE is required to ensure	
the correct temporal activation of MyoD transcription during	
development (12, 26). The fact that the CE has been shown to be	
critical for proper temporal expression of MyoD during development and now for the circadian expression of MyoD raises	
intriguing questions about the possibility that (i) CLOCK and/or	
BMAL1 have a noncircadian function during myogenesis and (ii)	
the CE serves as a “timing” module to provide a temporal component to MyoD expression during embryonic development and	
adulthood. At this time, CLOCK and/or BMAL1 have not been	
shown to regulate developmental gene expression in mammals,	
but there are some studies linking their homologs to development in Arabidopsis (27).	
As a global assessment of muscle-tissue function, we found	
that the speciﬁc tension of skeletal muscle was signiﬁcantly depressed in the circadian mutant mice. Surprisingly, skeletal	
muscle from both ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice displayed a similar reduction in speciﬁc tension, and these deﬁcits are very	
comparable to those observed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy	
as well as those seen with aging (28, 29). An important consideration for interpretations of our ﬁndings is that even though the	
muscle pathologies reported in the Bmal1−/−and ClockΔ19 mice	
are similar, the health and phenotype of the mice are profoundly	
different. The ClockΔ19 mouse has a normal life span, but it	
exhibits signs of metabolic disease by 8 mo of age (16). The	
Bmal1−/−mice die around 12 mo of age but, when they are 10 wk	
of age, Bmal1−/−mice have similar body weight, normal skeletalmuscle ﬁber area, and normal distribution of circulating white	
blood cells compared with control mice (17). Our experiments	
were performed on mice 12–14 wk of age at a time when neither	
Bmal1−/−nor ClockΔ19 mice show signiﬁcant disease status (16,	
17, 30). Thus, we suggest that the reduction in skeletal-muscle	
function is not likely a result of a speciﬁc behavior but instead	
due to alterations in molecular clock function. We also found	
that the deﬁcits recorded for whole-muscle tissue were present at	
the single-cell level. These ﬁndings are consistent with the concept that proper function of the molecular clock in skeletalmuscle ﬁber/cell is critical for maintenance of muscle function.	
Molecular Clock and Mitochondria in Skeletal Muscle. We also	
detected signiﬁcant mitochondrial pathologies in skeletal muscles	
of the ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice. We found a 40% reduction in	
mitochondrial volume, and the remaining mitochondria displayed	
morphological defects characterized by swelling and disrupted	
cristae. These initial observations from EM analyses were	
strengthened by our results that mitochondria from both gastrocnemius anddiaphragm muscles ofBmal1−/−micewerefunctionally	
impaired as indicated by a reduced RCR. In contrast, we can	
conclude that the mitochondrial phenotype was independent of	
MyoD because it was not observed in the muscles of MyoD−/−mice.	
On the basis of the well-established role of PGC-1 in the	
regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle, we	
propose that dysregulation of the PGC-1 family is a potential	
molecular link to the mitochondrial pathology observed in	
skeletal muscle of ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice (31). Recent	
studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 contributes to the control	
of the molecular clock (32–34), and PGC-1 and SIRT1 have	
been shown to interact to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and	
fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle (35). The results from this	
study found that Pgc-1β expression was no longer circadian in the	
muscle of ClockΔ19 mice and that Pgc-1α expression, although	
not circadian, was signiﬁcantly decreased in muscle of both	
ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice. These results are in agreement with	
recent ﬁnding of Liu et al. that Pgc-1α expression cycles in	
skeletal muscle (36). Taken together, our results conﬁrm that	
Pgc-1 expression is circadian in skeletal muscle and becomes	
down-regulated and/or nonrhythmic in muscle of ClockΔ19 and	
Bmal1−/−mice. These ﬁndings suggest that interactions between	
the PGC-1 coactivators and SIRT1 might link the molecular	
clock with daily maintenance of fundamental metabolic/mitochondrial pathways in skeletal muscle.	
In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that cell	
structure and function of skeletal muscle is impaired in ClockΔ19	
and Bmal1−/−mice. Evidence is growing that links inﬂammation,	
cancer, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, and metabolic	
disease with altered expression of the molecular clock in peripheral tissues (37–39). Thus, the signiﬁcant force and metabolic deﬁcits in the muscle of ClockΔ19 and Bmal1−/−mice open	
the possibility that the profound peripheral weakness and fatigue	
seen in chronic diseases may result from disruption of proper	
circadian factor expression in muscle.	
Materials and Methods	
Animals. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals as approved	
by the University of Illinois and University of Kentucky Institutional Animal	
Care and Use Committees. In addition to C57BL/6J or BALB/c mice (Jackson	
Laboratory), designated as wild type for each genotype, three mutant strains	
of mice were used in the current study: homozygous ClockΔ19 (isogenic C57BL/	
6J) (40), homozygous MOP3/Bmal1−/−null mutant (congenic on C57BL/6J)	
(41), and homozygous MyoD−/−null mutant (isogenic BALB/c) (42). Mice	
were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room maintained	
on a 12-h light–dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.	
Muscle Function. Maximum isometric tetanic force was determined in EDL	
muscles from mice [wild type (n = 4), ClockΔ19 (n = 7), Bmal1−/−(n = 3), and	
MyoD−/−(n = 4)] following procedures described previously (43).

20 ﬁbers of wild type; n = 7 ﬁbers of Bmal1−/−) were prepared from EDL	
muscles using a technique similar to that described by Campbell and Moss	
(44). Experimental records were acquired and analyzed using SLControl	
software (14).	
Electron Microscopy. Mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Skeletal muscle was ﬁxed by	
transcardial perfusion with ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde/4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and 130 mM NaCl. Perfusionﬁxed samples were taken to the microscopy center for further processing.	
Thin sections were cut and stained, and images were obtained for quantiﬁcation of mitochondrial volume, assessment of mitochondrial ultrastructure, and myoﬁlament organization.	
Mitochondrial Volume. The volume of the muscle ﬁber occupied by mitochondria in skeletal muscle from wild-type, ClockΔ19, Bmal1−/−, and MyoD−/−	
mice (n = 5/genotype) was determined using the electron microscopy pointcounting method as described by Eisenberg and Salmons (45). To prevent analytical bias, all images were coded and put in random order before counting.	
Mitochondrial Respiration. Mitochondrial isolation and respiration from	
skeletal muscle was performed as described by Singh et al. (46). For each	
experiment, fresh mitochondria were isolated and used within 3 h.	
Gene Expression Analysis. Wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice were entrained to a light:	
dark (LD) 12:12 cycle for 2 wk, placed in light-tight boxes on a LD 12:12 cycle	
for 4 wk, and then released into constant darkness (DD). Starting 30 h after	
entry into DD (CT18), skeletal muscles from ﬁve mice were collected every 4 h	
for 48 h. At time points CT34 through CT58 in DD, muscles from age-matched	
ClockΔ19 mice that had been treated with the same light protocol as the	
wild-type mice were collected. The muscles were removed from each hind	
leg and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Real-time quantitative PCR using TaqMan	
(Applied Biosystems) assays was used to validate the gene expression data	
generated from microarray analysis as previously reported for MyoD, Pgc-1α,	
and Pgc-1β (7).	
Western Blots. Skeletal muscle was homogenized in lysis buffer, and samples	
were electrophoresed on 10% SDS/PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane	
(Millipore) as described previously (43). Membranes were incubated with

Andrews et al.	
a polyclonal antibody against MyoD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or γ-tubulin	
(Sigma-Aldrich) followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-linked	
anti-rabbit antibody or anti-mouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The membrane	
was exposed to ECF substrate (Amersham Bioscience), and signals were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Storm 860; Amersham Bioscience).	
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay. Skeletal muscles were collected at the	
appropriate circadian time under constant dark conditions as described above	
(Gene Expression Analysis). Muscle tissues were homogenized in 1% formaldehyde buffer, and nuclei were isolated on the basis of protocols adapted	
from a method described by Ripperger and Schibler (47). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with BMAL1 or CLOCK antibody (Abcam) or	
nonspeciﬁc IgG or no antibody as controls. After clearing, samples were	
treated with Proteinase K (10 mg/mL) and DNA recovered for PCR. Primers	
were designed to amplify an ∼100-bp region within either the MyoD CE or	
DRR using AccuPrime Pfx Taq polymerase (Invitrogen).	
Construction of the 6.8MyoD and CE-6.8MyoD Reporter Vectors. We used the	
MD6.8-lacZ clone (gift from S. Tapscott, The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) as a template to clone 6.8 kb of upstream 5′	
ﬂanking sequence into the pGL3basic vector (Promega). Mouse genomic	
DNA was then used as a template to clone the CE, which was subsequently inserted upstream of the 6.8-kb ﬂanking sequence to produce	
the CE-6.8MyoD reporter vector. The sequence of the CE-6.8MyoD clone	
was veriﬁed by sequencing before being used in transient transfection	
experiments. The Per1 reporter vector, as previously described by Wilsbacher et al. (48), was used as a positive control in the transfection	
experiments.	
Transfection Experiments. C2C12 cells (n = 6–8/condition) were transiently	
transfected with expression vectors for Clock, Bmal1, or ClockΔ19 cDNAs with	
either the Per1 reporter vector or the 6.8MyoD or CE-6.8MyoD reporter	
vector using the Fugene6 reagent (Roche). The pRL vector (Promega) was	
used to control for transfection efﬁciency. Cells were collected 24–48 h after	
transfection and lysed with the passive lysis buffer, and luciferase activities	
were measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay System according to the	
manufacturer’s directions (Promega).

August 3, 2015)	
Diurnal oscillations of gene expression are a hallmark of rhythmic	
physiology across most living organisms. Such oscillations are controlled by the interplay between the circadian clock and feeding	
rhythms. Although rhythmic mRNA accumulation has been extensively studied, comparatively less is known about their transcription	
and translation. Here, we quantified simultaneously temporal transcription, accumulation, and translation of mouse liver mRNAs under	
physiological light–dark conditions and ad libitum or night-restricted	
feeding in WT and brain and muscle Arnt-like 1 (Bmal1)-deficient	
animals. We found that rhythmic transcription predominantly drives	
rhythmic mRNA accumulation and translation for a majority of	
genes. Comparison of wild-type and Bmal1 KO mice shows that circadian clock and feeding rhythms have broad impact on rhythmic	
gene expression, Bmal1 deletion affecting surprisingly both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Translation efficiency is differentially regulated during the diurnal cycle for genes with	
5′-Terminal Oligo Pyrimidine tract (5′-TOP) sequences and for genes	
involved in mitochondrial activity, many harboring a Translation Initiator of Short 5′-UTR (TISU) motif. The increased translation efficiency	
of 5′-TOP and TISU genes is mainly driven by feeding rhythms but	
Bmal1 deletion also affects amplitude and phase of translation, including TISU genes. Together this study emphasizes the complex interconnections between circadian and feeding rhythms at several steps	
ultimately determining rhythmic gene expression and translation.

L	
iving organisms on Earth are subjected to light–dark cycles	
caused by rotation of the Earth around the sun. To anticipate	
these changes, virtually all organisms have acquired a circadian	
timing system during evolution that allows a better adaptation to	
their environment. As a consequence, most aspects of their physiology are orchestrated in a rhythmic way by the circadian clock	
(from the Latin circa diem, meaning “about a day”), an endogenous	
and autonomous oscillator with a period of around 24 h (1, 2). Not	
surprisingly, perturbations of this clock in mammals lead to pathologies including psychiatric, metabolic, and vascular disorders (1,	
3, 4). At the organismal scale, the oscillatory clockwork is organized	
in a hierarchal manner. Within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of	
the hypothalamus, the “master clock” receives light input via the	
retina and communicates timing signals to “enslave” oscillators in	
peripheral organs (1, 2). The molecular oscillator consists of interconnected transcriptional and translational feedback loops, in which	
multiple layers of control, including temporal posttranscriptional	
and posttranslational regulation, play important roles (5). These	
additional layers of regulation are largely coordinated by systemic	
cues originating from circadian clock and/or feeding-coordinated	
rhythmic metabolism, allowing the adjustment of the molecular	
clockwork with the metabolic state of the cell (6). During the last	
decades, efforts have been made to produce a comprehensive	
knowledge of the transcriptional regulation orchestrated by the	
circadian clock (7–9) and feeding rhythms (10, 11). More recently,	
additional layers of regulation at the translational (12, 13) and	
posttranslational (14) levels have been described, increasing the	
complexity of the phenomenon involved in the establishment of the	
rhythmic mRNA expression and protein synthesis landscapes.	
To gain more insight into potential rhythmic coordination at all	
stages of mRNA regulation, we monitored simultaneously mRNA	
transcription, accumulation, and translation using total RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling (15, 16).We describe here a	
modified protocol of this technique that allows deep sequencing	
of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments rapidly and with high	
throughput from mouse tissues. We measured transcription, accumulation, and translation of mouse liver mRNAs under different	
feeding rhythms and in clock-deficient animals. In this way, we	
Significance	
Rhythmic gene regulation in mouse liver results from an intertwined relationship between feeding cycles and the circadian clock.	
Significant efforts have been made to understand this interaction	
but a complete picture of the resulting diurnal transcription–translation processes is still missing. Through the simultaneous quantification of temporal transcription, accumulation, and translation of	
mRNA in the liver, we investigated the regulatory landscape of	
mice with intact or deficient circadian clock subjected to different	
feeding regimens. We showed that circadian clock and feeding	
rhythms coordinate rhythmic transcription to drive downstream	
rhythmic mRNA accumulation and translation. However, a subset	
of genes harboring 5′-Terminal Oligo Pyrimidine tract or Translation	
Initiator of Short 5′-UTR elements encoding proteins involved in	
translation and mitochondrial activity, respectively, present a	
transcription-independent rhythmic translation mainly regulated	
by feeding.

showed that rhythmic transcription drives predominantly rhythmic	
mRNA accumulation and translation for a majority of genes. The	
study of WT and brain and muscle Arnt-like 1 (Bmal1) KO mice	
shows that the interconnection between circadian clock and feeding	
rhythms has broad impacts on rhythmic genes expression. Surprisingly, Bmal1 deletion seems to alter posttranscriptional level more	
importantly than transcription. In addition, it seems that global	
mRNA accumulation drives translation whereas a small subset of	
genes presents a diurnal change in their translation efficiency. These	
genes are involved in translation or mitochondrial activity and	
harbor a 5′-Terminal Oligo Pyrimidine tract (5′-TOP) or Translation Initiator of Short 5′-UTR (TISU) motif, respectively. Their	
rhythmic translation efficiency is mainly driven by feeding rhythms	
and food restriction increases their amplitudes and temporal coordination. However, Bmal1 deletion also affects amplitudes and	
phases of mRNA translation, notably for TISU genes. By measuring	
simultaneously all of the aspects of mRNA regulation, this study	
shows for the first time to our knowledge the role of circadian and	
feeding rhythms in the establishment of rhythmic mRNA and protein synthesis.	
Results	
Ribosome Profiling Around the Diurnal Cycle in Mouse Liver. To	
monitor temporal mRNA transcription, accumulation, and	
translation, we extracted total RNA and ribosome-protected	
mRNA fractions from livers of individual mice every 2 h under	
ad libitum feeding (ALF). In parallel, the same experiment was	
performed every 4 h in WT and Bmal1 KO animals under a	
night-restricted feeding (RF) regimen. In total, 84 samples were	
subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) (Fig. 1A). For RNA-Seq, intronic reads provide	
a good proxy for transcription rate and exonic reads for mRNA	
abundance (17). Owing to the large number of samples, we developed a simplified and faster protocol for ribosome profiling	
library generation, similar to that in ref. 18. Briefly, ribosome	
footprints (RFPs) ends were modified with polynucleotide kinase to generate libraries using 5′- and 3′- mRNA adapters. The	
quality and reproducibility of the resulting Ribo-Seq libraries	
were high (Fig. S1), showing a low percentage of PCR duplicates	
and minor sequence-dependent ligation (Fig. S2).	
Overall, Ribo-Seq reads mapped mainly on coding DNA sequences (CDSs) (Fig. 1B) with a mean footprint size surrounding	
32 nucleotides (Fig. 1C), consistent with previous results obtained	
in mammalian cells or tissues (18–21) as well as with ribosome size. Biological reproducibility for both RNA-Seq and	
Ribo-Seq was high (Fig. 1D; R2 of 0.97 and 0.96, respectively).	
Moreover, mRNA abundance and total ribosome density still	
exhibited fairly high correlation (R2 = 0.73), highlighting both	
the overall proportionality between number of translating ribosomes and number of transcripts, as well as gene-specific translational kinetics (initiation or elongation). Finally, densities of	
ribosome footprints at the starts and ends of CDSs in proteincoding transcripts exhibited the expected trinucleotide repeat,	
reflecting the main ORF and the three-nucleotide movement of	
the ribosomes (Fig. 1E). Together, these results emphasize that	
this technique allows us to obtain with high throughput a highquality dataset that can be used to monitor simultaneously transcription, mRNA abundance, and translation in different conditions.	
Rhythmic Ribosome Footprint Signal Is Mainly Driven by Rhythmic	
mRNA Accumulation. We first investigated gene expression in ALF	
mice. Considering some well-studied circadian clock-regulated genes	
(e.g., Dbp) confirmed that our data are of high quality and showed	
the expected rhythmicity for both RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq (Fig. 2A).	
As anticipated, circadian clock genes show rhythms at all stages, from	
their respective pre-mRNAs to the accumulation of the mRNA and	
downstream mRNA translation (Fig. 2B), confirming that translational regulation has a minor impact upon clock gene expression	
(12). To assess and quantify rhythmic regulations at the different	
steps, we developed computational models and classified genes	
depending on the rhythmic or constant behavior at each measured	
level (pre-mRNA, mRNA, and ribosome footprints) (Dataset S1).	
For a great majority of genes, rhythmically translated mRNAs are	
subjected to rhythmic mRNA accumulation and a significant part of	
those (72%) exhibit rhythmic transcription (Fig. 2C).	
We evaluated the impact of rhythmic translation on rhythmic	
protein levels by comparing mRNA and RFP levels with recently	
published protein levels (14). As described for rhythmic mRNAs,	
the majority of rhythmic RFPs encoded nonrhythmic proteins, likely	
as a consequence of long protein half-lives (Fig. S3). However, these	
observed flat profiles in protein abundance do not necessarily indicate flat activity because, for example, newly synthesized proteins	
can be more active than old oxidized proteins (22–24). Therefore,	
total protein level quantified by mass spectrometry may not always	
reflect rhythmic activity of newly synthesized protein originating	
from rhythmic RFP accumulation. However, rhythmic RFP signals	
typically show no significant delay with mRNA accumulation,	
whereas an average delay of around 6 h is observed between RFP	
signals and protein accumulation, as expected for relatively longlived proteins (Fig. 3C) (14).

Among genes with rhythmic RFP levels that follow their corresponding mRNA accumulation, we observed three major groups	
with distinct transcriptional behaviors (Fig. 2D) and phase specificity (Fig. 2E). Namely, Group A is composed of genes with the	
same rhythmic parameters for introns and exons, introns and exons	
of group B genes present different rhythmic parameters, and group	
C genes are rhythmic only at the exonic level. Expression data for a	
few examples of each model are presented in Fig. S4. Surprisingly,	
each group shows specific gene ontology enrichment, suggesting a	
close relationship between biological functions, time of expression,	
and mode of rhythmic accumulation (Dataset S2). As described	
previously (25), the main difference between mRNA accumulation	
in groups A and B resulted from the different half-lives of these	
mRNAs. We used RNA-Seq exon/intron ratios as proxies for relative mRNA half-lives and found that group A genes exhibited a	
lower ratio than group B genes, suggesting shorter half-life (Fig.	
2F). As a consequence of the increased stability of group B genes,	
mRNA amplitudes were reduced compared with amplitudes of	
pre-mRNAs (Fig. 2G). To summarize, group A genes reached	
their maximum expression at the light–dark transition and coded for	
short-lived mRNA that were mainly related to transcription and cell	
signaling, in particular insulin signaling. Short half-lives for translation- or signaling-related mRNA are expected to generate the	
required rapid responses to signals. In parallel, group B showed a	
bimodal distribution of mRNA phases and was mainly composed of	
genes with stable mRNAs that encode proteins involved in lipid and	
carbohydrate metabolism. Finally, rhythmic regulation for group C	
mRNA occurred only posttranscriptionally and concerns genes related to chromatin organization and mRNA metabolism, with sharp	
phase specificity at the end of the light phase.	
Bmal1 Deletion Affects Rhythmic mRNA Accumulation Transcriptionally	
and Posttranscriptionally. To decipher the specific roles of the circadian clock and feeding rhythms on transcriptional regulation, we	
performed the same experiment on Bmal1 KO mice under RF	
(Dataset S1). To compare rhythmic pattern of genes in the two	
different animal models at the pre-mRNA and mRNA levels, we	
grouped genes into six groups according to the respective rhythmic	
pattern at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (Fig. 3).	
These respective groups are composed of genes with constant premRNA and mRNA (light blue), constant pre-mRNA and rhythmic	
mRNA (dark blue), rhythmic pre-mRNA and constant mRNA	
(orange), rhythmic with the same rhythmic parameters pre-mRNA	
and mRNA (red), rhythmic pre-mRNA and mRNA with different	
rhythmic parameters (brown), and finally genes with very low expression levels or noisy transcription and accumulation (gray) that	
cannot be included in any other category (Fig. 3A). It seems that	
rhythmicity is globally preserved with only moderate increase of

temporally constant genes at the mRNA level in KO (light blue and	
orange groups, Fig. 3A). However, we observed a decreased number	
of genes in KO for which rhythmicity in WT is caused by posttranscriptional regulations (dark blue and brown groups, Fig. 3A),	
suggesting that Bmal1 deletion also affects posttranscriptional regulation. To compare how the rhythmic pattern of each gene	
changed between WT and KO animals, we studied their distribution among the five different groups reporting interesting patterns	
(Fig. 3B). Although a majority of genes remained in the same group	
as in WT, there was a clear spreading of the distribution of genes	
among the groups, indicating that Bmal1 deletion affected the	
general rhythmic pattern of genes. In addition, the expression phase	
of both pre-mRNA and mRNA was shifted in the KO compared	
with WT. However, this occurred in both directions, without clear	
further specificity (Fig. 3 C and D). Interestingly, for genes	
showing rhythmic patterns of expression in both WT and KO, the	
amplitudes of such rhythms at the mRNA level were, on average,	
clearly decreased in KO, whereas the amplitude of pre-mRNA was	
slightly increased (Fig. 3 E and F).	
Concerning the change of pattern of rhythmic gene expression	
between WT and KO animals, one group was of particular interest, namely genes that were nonrhythmic at the pre-mRNA	
and rhythmic at the mRNA levels in WT (dark blue group) and that	
became rhythmic at both levels in the KO (red group). This group	
of genes was the only group whose pattern was severely perturbed in	
the KO (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, these genes tended to show transcription (pre-mRNA) rhythms with a period of at 12 h in WT (Fig.	
3G) that morphed onto 24 h rhythms in the KO. It was previously	
described that 12-h-period genes changed to 24-h period in circadian clock-deficient mice (26, 27). It is likely that the two peaks of	
the 12-h rhythm are regulated by the circadian clock and feeding	
rhythms, respectively, and that the circadian component disappeared	
in the KO (27). Thus, the change of rhythmic pattern in this group	
reflects such a change of periodicity.	
Translation Efficiency Is Regulated During the Diurnal Cycle for Genes	
with 5′-Terminal Oligo Pyrimidine Tract and Translation Initiator of	
Short 5′-UTR Motifs. Although translation of most genes followed	
mRNA accumulation (Fig. 2), we identified a subset of genes	
exhibiting rhythmic translation efficiency in WT mice under the	
ALF condition. Indeed, these genes showed rhythmic translation, but their mRNA accumulated at constant levels (Fig. 2C).	
As we recently reported, ribosomal proteins (RPs) are translated	
in a rhythmic manner from constantly accumulated mRNA (12).	
We confirmed here that translation of RPs was regulated diurnally, as shown for Rps9 (Fig. 4A). Although some of the genes	
with rhythmic translation efficiency exhibited rhythmic transcription, the vast majority showed constant transcription (Fig.	
4B and Dataset S1). The genes with rhythmic translation efficiency showed a bimodal phase of translation and encompassed	
two different main functions: The genes translated during the	
day at around ZT 10 are related to mitochondrial functions, whereas	
those translated at night around ZT 17 are related to the translation	
machinery, including RPs (Fig. 4C and Dataset S2). These functional	
clusters were enriched in genes harboring a TISU or 5′-TOP elements, respectively (Fig. 4D and Fig. S5). TISU elements have a	
conserved translation initiation sequence preceded by an extremely short 5′-UTR, and direct efficient cap-dependent translation initiation without scanning, thus conferring an advantageous

mechanism under an inhibited translation state, as induced by nutrient starvation (28–30). However, target of rapamycin complex 1	
(TORC1) has been shown to be the main regulator of TOP	
mRNA translation through the phosphorylation of 4E-BP and	
S6K proteins under nutrient availability conditions (31). Consistent with these observations, translation of TOP mRNAs occurs at the same phase as TORC1 activation (Fig. 4D and Fig.	
S6), as described previously (12). In addition, we compared	
translationally regulated genes with a study reporting on the effect	
of Torin 1-induced inhibition of TORC1-dependent translation	
(32). This showed that the translation of TOP genes was dramatically decreased, whereas the translation of TISU genes was	
poorly affected (Fig. S5C). Notably, rhythmic RFP accumulation	
exhibited variability across individual mice (Fig. 4 E and F),	
reflecting individual feeding behavior in this condition (33). These	
findings strengthened that idea that nutrient availability may affect	
rhythmic translation of TOP and TISU mRNAs.	
Rhythms in Translation Efficiency Are Sharpened Under RF. Because	
nutrient availability is a key regulator of translation for both TISU	
and TOP genes, we wondered whether RF would affect their	
rhythmic translation efficiencies. Similar to the ALF condition, we	
observed that rhythmically translated genes were enriched in TOP	
and TISU genes involved in similar biological functions (Fig. 5A and	
Datasets S1 and S2). Interestingly, rhythmic translation of TOP and	
TISU genes exhibited a narrower phase with a higher amplitude	
compared with ALF. Rhythmic translation of mitochondrial-related	
TISU genes still occurred during the light phase in RF but presented an advanced phase (Fig. 5 B and C). In addition, the	
translational rhythms of TOP and TISU genes seemed to be reinforced by RF in the individual mice, synchronously with the availability or absence of food, respectively (Fig. 5D). TORC1 and	
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activities were previously	
shown to be synchronized to TOP and TISU translation, respectively, in response to nutrient availability (30, 31). We monitored	
these activities through the rhythmic phosphorylation of RPS6 and	
RAPTOR, showing increased coordination and amplitude under	
RF (Fig. S6). Taken together, these results argue in favor of a	
pivotal role of feeding rhythms on translation regulation of both	
TISU and TOP mRNAs.	
Bmal1 Deletion Affects Rhythmic mRNA Translation Only for a Subset	
of Genes. We used the same model selection method described	
for transcription to decipher differential translational regulation	
in WT and KO mice (Dataset S1). Rhythmic mRNA translation	
was globally conserved, although a small decrease was observed	
for the proportion of rhythmically translated mRNAs in the KO	
(Fig. 6A). Overall, genes had a tendency to follow the same	
pattern of rhythmic translation. We noticed, however, genes that	
exhibited rhythmic mRNA accumulation but constant or delayed	
RFP signal in WT (orange and brown groups) but synchronized	
mRNA and RFP signal in KO (red group) (Fig. 6B). This behavior	
could be hypothetically the consequence of an absence of translational regulation in KO, potentially caused by perturbed expression of RNA-binding proteins that regulate this translation.	
Interestingly, although the amplitudes of RFP signals of TOP	
genes was not affected by the Bmal1 deletion, it seemed that	
rhythmic translation of TISU genes showed slightly decreased	
amplitude (Fig. 6 D and E). Consequently, TISU genes were more	
enriched among the fraction of constantly translated mRNA (Fig. 6

B–E). This could be linked to the loss of rhythmic energy consumption observed in clock-disrupted animals (11). However,	
overall, Bmal1 deletion had only a small effect in regulating	
translation efficiency between WT and KO mice, with translation	
rhythms mostly reflecting mRNA accumulation (Fig. 6F and	
Dataset S1). We nevertheless identified 16 genes that showed	
increased or decreased translation efficiency in KO mice, with no

Discussion	
Regulation of mRNA Accumulation by Circadian and Feeding Rhythms.	
We took advantage of the RNA-Seq technology to decipher the	
role of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations (17) in the	
establishment of the diurnally rhythmic transcriptome in mouse liver.	
We concluded that transcription is the main regulator of rhythmic	
mRNA accumulation (66% of rhythmic mRNA are rhythmically	
transcribed) (Fig. 2). Recent studies using different technologies to	
address this question yielded divergent results (Table S1). Although	
two studies concluded that transcriptional regulation constitutes the	
main origin of rhythm mRNA accumulation (ref. 34 and this study),	
two others concluded that this origin is mainly posttranscriptional (7,	
35). Interestingly, analysis of these data through a new approach—	
taking into account mRNA degradation—led to the observation that	
∼70% of transcripts are not subjected to posttranscriptional regulation, in accordance with our conclusion (36). At this stage, it is difficult to conclude to what extent these differences depend on the	
techniques used or data analysis pipelines. However, one key difference between these studies resides in the feeding conditions: nightrestricted in the first case (34) and ad libitum in the second one (7,	
35). Feeding rhythms play a central role in the activation of metabolically regulated pathways and transcription factors, as exemplified	
by the regulation of SREBP (37, 38). It is therefore possible that	
night-restricted feeding contributes to increased amplitude and coordination of rhythmic transcription in addition to its role in rhythmic	
mRNA translation for a particular subset of genes. As a consequence, RF decreased the influence of posttranscriptional regulation on mRNA accumulation compared with ALF, as suggested by	
the higher proportion of rhythmic mRNAs originating from rhythmic	
transcription. This conclusion is consistent with previous reports that	
night- or day-restricted feeding increases the number of cycling	
transcripts as well as the amplitude of their mRNA accumulation	
in mouse liver (10, 11).	
Concerning diurnally rhythmic genes, we observed a clear relationship between the mode of rhythmic accumulation, notably	
related to mRNA half-life, the phase preferences, and the biological	
functions (Fig. 2). Correlations between mRNA stability and biological function are well-described in different animal cell models	
(39, 40). In particular, cells can rapidly change the levels of mRNAs	
coding for proteins involved in signaling and transcription, whereas	
longer-lived mRNAs coding for proteins involved in metabolism	
can contribute to damp fluctuations in the induction of such genes.	
In our analysis, genes showing short delay (short half-lives) between	
transcription and mRNA accumulation tended to code for signaling	
proteins linked with food response (such as insulin signaling) and	
were expressed at the day/night transition. Meanwhile, genes with	
longer delays (longer half-lives) between transcription and mRNA	
accumulation tended to be involved in metabolism and showed a	
biphasic distribution of phases with peaks at the end of the light and	
dark periods. These two phases could be explained by the required	
separation of incompatible metabolic processes (41). A last group of	
genes coded for proteins involved in chromatin organization and	
peaked at the end of the light period. Interestingly, genes involved	
in chromatin organization, like histones, are known to be regulated	
at the posttranscriptional level with a large increase in accumulation	
in S phase (42). Thus, it may be that the increased accumulation of	
these mRNA is linked to the observed rhythmic DNA synthesis that	
occurred in rodent liver (43, 44).	
In addition, the analysis of Bmal1 KO animals allowed us to study	
the role of the circadian clock on rhythmic mRNA accumulation.	
Our results showed that Bmal1 deletion, although affecting the	
phases and amplitudes of many rhythmic genes, induced relatively	
moderate changes, which was reminiscent of previous studies	
showing that the ClockΔ19 mutation had a globally minor effect on	
rhythmic transcripts (45). More surprisingly, it seemed that Bmal1	
deletion had a significant impact at the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA levels. It was recently shown that posttranscriptional	
modifications involving pre-mRNA metabolism or miRNAs can	
influence rhythmic genes pattern (13, 46, 47). To which extent these	
processes are controlled by the circadian clock is presently not	
understood. Analysis of another genotype, the Cry1/Cry2 KO,	
showed that global rhythmic mRNA accumulation was strongly	
perturbed (11). However, these experiments were performed	
under ad libitum feeding and constant darkness conditions. Such	
conditions are very likely to induce arrhythmia in these animals	
(48), whereas our experiments were performed under light–dark	
cycles and night feeding conditions to separate feeding behavior	
and clock-related effects. It is thus likely that the arrhythmic	
feeding is responsible of the major disturbance of rhythmic	
mRNA accumulation observed in Cry1/Cry2 KO (11).	
Mechanisms of Rhythmic Translational Regulation. Although rhythmic coordination of transcription and mRNA accumulation has	
been extensively studied during the last decades, rhythmic translation has been described only recently in mammals. Indeed, it has	
been shown that the TORC1 pathway is rhythmically activated in	
mouse liver (12, 49), hippocampus (50), and SCN (51), influencing	
in this way rhythmic ribosome biogenesis (12) or light response and	
circadian behavior (52, 53). Moreover, the circadian clock, in coordination with feeding rhythms, seems to play a modulating role in	
this activation (12, 54, 55). Although we confirmed the rhythmic	
activation of the TORC1 pathway in mouse liver, it seemed that	
Bmal1 deletion had no effect on the rhythms of TOP genes translation; in particular, the amplitudes were indistinguishable (Fig.	
6D). Even though this observation seems contradictory to our	
previously published results showing that rhythmic RP accumulation is perturbed in the liver of clock-disrupted mice (12), it is important to note that RP synthesis is only one part of the ribosome	
biogenesis. Indeed, it comprises numerous steps including rRNA	
synthesis and maturation and ribosome assembly that strongly influence RP stability and accumulation (56). Interestingly, recent	
results from our laboratory show that these steps are also rhythmic	
and, at least in part, under circadian clock control. It is therefore	
possible that these clock-regulated processes influence rhythmic RP	
stability and accumulation and explain this apparent discrepancy.	
A recent study showed that the circadian clock can directly regulate mRNA translation through the direct interaction of BMAL1	
with the translation machinery. As a consequence, total mRNA	
translation follows a global rhythmic pattern that is lost in the liver	
of Bmal1 KO mice, which also show decreased mRNA translation	
throughout the day (57). To date, we and others have also shown	
that global translation is rhythmic in mouse liver (12, 58, 59).	
However, the RFP experiments presented here, which measure	
relative translation efficiencies, highlight that diurnal relative	
changes in translation are predominantly regulated by transcriptional regulation and feeding rhythms. Indeed, the amplitudes	
associated with diurnally regulated translation efficiencies seemed	
to be only moderately affected by the deletion of Bmal1 (Fig. 6 D	
and E) and differential translation efficiency concerned only a	
very small number of mRNAs at the single-gene level (Fig. 6G).	
One interesting finding consisted of the rhythmic regulation of	
TISU genes (28, 29). Recently, it was shown that these genes are	
protected from AMPK-induced translation inhibition (30), and the	
rhythmic activation of the AMPK pathway thus provides an explanation for their rhythmic translation activation (12, 60). TISU	
elements are predominantly found in nucleus-encoded mitochondrial protein and their translational properties affect mitochondrial	
activity (30). Remarkably, the TORC1 pathway was also shown to	
regulate translation of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes and	
mitochondrial activity (61). Incidentally, mitochondrial oxidative	
activity is rhythmic and under the control of the circadian clock	
(62–64), and this rhythmic activity is attributed in part to the clockdependent regulation of NAD+ synthesis through the transcriptional regulation of the Nampt gene (65, 66). To what extend the	
rhythmic synthesis of mitochondrial proteins modulated by the	
circadian clock also contributes to this phenomenon remains to	
be demonstrated.	
Consequence of Desynchronized Circadian Clock and Feeding Rhythms.	
Energy balance is controlled by a complex interaction between metabolic pathways and transcriptional effectors. During	
the last decades, many efforts have been made to understand

the transcriptional regulation orchestrated by the circadian clock	
and feeding cycles. For example, rhythmicity in gene expression	
(11) and in metabolite accumulation (33) can be partially restored	
in clock-deficient mice by a restricted feeding regimen. This feeding constraint consolidates rhythmicity in gene expression and	
metabolism and can protect against obesity in a high-fat diet	
regimen without reducing caloric intake (10, 67). We showed here	
that feeding rhythms can also sustain rhythmic posttranscriptional	
regulation and mRNA translation of genes coding for proteins	
involved in key metabolic pathways, adding a new level of	
regulation leading to rhythmic metabolism and physiology.	
Feeding–fasting cycles seem to be the main timing cues for the	
liver clock, even bypassing the master clock in the brain (68, 69),	
which has led to the hypothesis that desynchrony of master and	
peripheral clocks under altered feeding conditions disrupts organisms’ homeostasis and predisposes them to chronic diseases. Recent	
studies linked growth and associated metabolic pathologies including metabolic syndrome and obesity to desynchronized clocks	
(1, 3, 6). Interestingly, many of these pathologies have also been	
linked to defects in ribosome biogenesis (70, 71) or mitochondrial	
activity (72, 73). Control of ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial	
function by the circadian clock and feeding rhythms could therefore	
provide key factors in pathologies associated with circadian disruption. In this way, the concept of chrononutrition, in the sense of	
synchronizing feeding rhythms to the circadian clock-imposed	
rhythmic metabolism, acquires a mechanistic basis and could lead to	
nonpharmacological strategies to prevent metabolic diseases (74).	
Materials and Methods	
Animal Experiments. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with	
Nestlé Animal Study Committee for animal experimentation and the regulations	
of the veterinary office of the Canton of Vaud. C57BL/6J mice were purchased	
from Charles River Laboratory. Bmal1 KO mice have been previously described	
(12). In all experiments, male mice between 10 and 14 wk of age were used. Mice	
were maintained under standard animal housing conditions, with free access to	
food and water, and in 12-h light/12-h dark cycles. However, for KO mice and	
their respective control littermates, animals were fed only at night 4 d before the	
organ collection to reduce effects of feeding rhythm. Parts of the collected livers	
were subsequently homogenized for the ribosome footprinting, and the rest of	
the organs were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C until used for total	
RNA and protein extractions.	
Ribosome Profiling Method.	
Ribosome footprinting. Immediately after the organ collection, livers were	
homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 250 mM NaCl,	
10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 20 μg/mL cycloheximide, 10 U/μL RNase inhibitor	
(New England Biolabs), and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 0.5 mM	
PMSF, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 0.7 μg/mL pepstatin A, and 0.7 μg/mL leupeptin.	
The homogenates were centrifuged 10 min at 9,500 × g at 4 °C and supernatants were supplemented with 1 mg/mL heparin, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,	
and 0.5% Triton ×10. Lysates were kept at −80 °C until use. Lysates were supplemented with RNase I (350 U/mg of protein; Invitrogen) and then incubated	
1 h at room temperature to generate RNA footprints. Treated lysates were loaded	
onto sucrose gradients (7–47% wt/vol) prepared in polysome buffer containing	
20 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. After 4.5 h of	
centrifugation at 130,000 × g at 4 °C, gradients were fractionated at ∼0.85 mL/min	
using a peristaltic pump and fractions corresponding to 40-s intervals were	
collected. Optic density at 260 nm of each fraction was measured to establish the monosomal profile in the gradient. Finally, fractions representing the monosomal peak were pooled and RNAs were extracted as	
described before (12). Briefly, fractions were precipitated by the addition of	
three volumes of ethanol and kept overnight at −80 °C. After 30 min of	
centrifugation at 5,200 × g, RNAs were extracted from the nonsoluble	
fraction by classic methods (75).	
Size selection of RFPs. Footprints were resolved on a 15% TBE Urea Page (Life	
Technologies) and gels were stained with SyberGold (Invitrogen). Using dedicated	
mRNA markers (76), 26- to 34-nt-long mRNAs fragments were extracted from the	
gels through overnight incubation into RNA gel extraction buffer [300 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.25% (wt/vol) SDS, supplemented with	
2 μl of glycogen (Ambion) and 1.5 μL of GlycoBlue (Ambion)]. Footprints were	
recovered by overnight precipitation in isopropanol at −80 °C and dissolved in	
100 μL of nuclease-free water. Purified RNAs were concentrated using the RNA	
Clean and Concentrator 5 kit (Zymo Research) following the recommended	
procedure to purify small RNA. The quality and the RNA concentration were	
assessed on a Bioanalyzer small RNA chip (Agilent Technologies).	
RFP end modifications. Eluted RNA (50–250 ng) was heat-denatured 3 min at	
65 °C and chilled on ice. The 3′-terminal cyclophosphate resulting from the	
RNase I digestion was removed in a 50-μL reaction with 10 U of T4 PNK (New	
England Biolabs) in the absence of ATP. After 60 min of incubation at 37 °C,	
ATP was supplemented to a final concentration of 1 mM together with an	
addition of 10 U T4 PNK and the reaction was further incubated 60 min at	
37 °C. RNAs were purified with the RNA Clean and Concentrator 5 kit (Zymo	
Research) and eluted once with 7 μL H2O.	
Library generation. Libraries were generated strictly following the Truseq Small	
RNA kit recommendations (Illumina). For the purpose of validation, we also	
tested the NEXTflex Small RNA Sequencing Kit v2 (Bioo Life Science), which	
uses adaptors carrying four random nucleotides at their ligated extremities,	
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Note that in both cases we did not	
directly perform the PCR amplification after the reverse transcription step	
(discussed below). The procedure starts with the whole RNA purified from	
the T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction (5 μL starting material, 25 ng to 250 ng	
small RNA). Only half of the ligated products was used for the reverse	
transcription reaction. The second half was stored at −80 °C as a backup.	
Determining the optimal number of PCR cycles. The optimal number of PCR cycles	
to be used was determined by a quantitative PCR (qPCR) performed on nonamplified DNA. Briefly, the nonamplified library (before the PCR step) is analyzed	
by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quant Kit (Kappa Biosystems), which is normally	
used for quantifying libraries following the final PCR amplification. No standard	
curve is required but the Cp (crossing point, equivalent to the threshold cycle, or	
Ct) obtained is corrected by a cycle correction factor (CCF) that we empirically	
determined after fluorimetric quantification of a final test library amplified for a	
known number of PCR cycles. As a result, we were able to anticipate the number	
of cycle that would yield the desired final concentration of each individual library.	
Importantly, the CCF is dependent on the qPCR cycler, qPCR mix, thermocycler in	
which the actual PCR amplification will be run. Its value has to be initially determined in the course of a test run but, after that, it can be considered as a	
constant for a given library generation protocol. Practically, the reverse transcription reaction is diluted 1/100 and the qPCR reaction assembled with 2 oligos	
that we specifically designed for the TruSeq Small RNA kit from Illumina	
(CAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGAT and TTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA). The 10-μL reaction was run on a Light Cycler 480 II (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s	
recommendations, with 0.3 μM primers. Cycling conditions consisted of an initial	
denaturation step of 5 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C and 45 s	
at 45 °C. The obtained Cp was first corrected for the dilution compared with the	
real PCR to be performed and then with the abovementioned CCF. In this experiment, we found a CCF value of +3 cycles.	
Library amplification. The PCR was designed following Illumina’s recommendation taking advantage of the indexed oligos. The calculated optimal PCR	
cycle number was generally homogenous among samples. In series of 48	
samples, we typically found around 5 samples that had to be amplified with	
a different cycle numbers (± 2 cycles from the average, which is generally	
10 cycles). These samples were amplified in a separate reaction.	
Library postprocessing. Libraries were purified with Ampure XP beads at a 2×	
ratio (cutoff below 100 bp for libraries around 150 bp) and the DNA eluted	
with 30 μL resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0). Libraries were quantified with Picogreen (Life Technology), which usually yields 75– 200 ng DNA,	
and size patterns were controlled using a DNA High Sensitivity Reagent kit	
on a Caliper GX device (Perkin-Elmer).	
Library sequencing. Samples were pooled based on the Illumina indices used	
(typically 12–24 samples are pooled together). This 10 nM pool was made equimolar with individual library concentrations calculated from Picogreen data and	
an average peak size of 155 bp. Pools were denatured with an equivolume	
amount of 100 mM NaOH and neutralized with HT1 buffer (Illumina) to reach a	
final concentration of 20 pM. Denatured pools are spiked with 10% PhiX and	
loaded onto a single-read flow cell v3 at a concentration of 8 pM strictly following	
Illumina’s recommendations. Sequencing was performed on a HiSEq. 2500 (Illumina) for 51 cycles. Optimal sequencing depth typically required loading an	
equivalent of 2–10 samples per lane depending on the scope of the experiment.	
Total RNA Sequencing. Liver RNAs were extracted as previously described (25)	
and libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample	
Prep Kit with the Ribo-Zero Gold depletion set (Illumina) following the	
manufacturer’s protocol. We used 250 ng total RNA as starting material and	
performed 11 PCR cycles from library amplification (optimal cycle determined with the same method as the small RNA, discussed above). Samples	
were pooled by 24, denatured, spiked with 3% PhiX, and loaded onto a	
paired-end read flow cell v3 at a final concentration of 11 pM for a paired-end

100 cycles run, strictly following Illumina’s recommendations. Sequencing	
depth was equivalent to three samples per lane.	
All of the data are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database	
under accession no. GSE73554.	
Data Analysis.	
Alignment of ribosome footprints. We used the Ensembl Mus Musculus genome	
annotation (assembly GRCm38/mm10) (77). Footprint sequences were first	
aligned against rRNA and tRNA sequences (obtained using genome.ucsc.edu/,	
filtered on rRNA and tRNA) using STAR 2.3.0 (78) with options -seedSearchStartLmax 15 -clip3pAdapterSeq TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGGAACTCCAGTCAC -outReadsUnmappedFastx. In this way, the STAR internal clipping function	
is used and reads are split into pieces no longer than 15 bp to avoid ambiguous	
mapping. Unmapped reads were then aligned with the same options to the	
reference genome. To improve accuracy on splice junctions, the index of the	
reference genome was built by considering the Ensembl annotation (using STAR	
-runMode genomeGenerate -sjdbGTFfile).	
Triplet periodicity analysis in ribosome footprints. Using a custom Perl script, 5′ ends	
of uniquely mapping reads (up to one mismatch) were analyzed in a window of	
50 bp around the annotated translation initiation site and translation end site.	
The fraction of reads at every position is computed for each transcript and averaged over all annotated transcripts. This analysis was performed for the 84	
samples independently.	
Quantification of ribosome footprints. For each Ensembl gene, all of the exons of	
the respective annotated protein-coding transcripts were considered. Reads	
up to one mismatch, with sizes between 29 and 35 nt, were counted considering only reads in the right orientation. Both uniquely mapping and	
multimapping reads were reported. Read counts were normalized by the	
respective library size, and by the average size of transcripts coding region.	
The resulting ribosome signals (in log2) are provided in Dataset S1.	
NEXTFlex analysis. Ribosome profiling reads were trimmed using fastx_clipper from	
fastx_toolkit with parameters -Q33 -a TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGGAACTCCAGTCAC -c -l 11 -M 5. Trimmed reads were filtered for unique sequences. The output	
was written in separated fasta files. Both groups of files containing unique sequences or all sequences were aligned independently using the same procedure:	
footprint sequences were first aligned against rRNA and tRNA with the options–	
seedSearchStartLmax 15–clip5pNbases 4–clip3pNbases 4–outReadsUnmappedFastx.	
In this way, the internal trimming function in STAR is used to skip the first and last	
four nucleotides (representing the random barcode). Unmapped reads were then	
aligned with the same options to the reference genome. For the quantification of	
ribosome footprints, our standard pipeline was used.	
Mapping of total RNA-Seq. Paired end reads were aligned to the same genome	
index than for the RFP using STAR.	
Quantification of exonic and intronic levels for each gene. Considering all Ensembl	
transcripts annotated to a particular gene, we first defined exonic and intronic	
regions. A region was defined as exonic if it occurs in at least one of the transcripts.	
Meanwhile, intronic regions had to be shared between all of the transcripts, to	
maximize specificity of the intronic read counts. Using a custom Perl script, we	
assigned uniquely mapping paired-end reads to exonic regions (in both cases of	
exon–exon junctions or read pairs entirely contained in one exon), or intronic	
regions (in both cases of intron–exon reads pairs, and ones entirely contained in	
one intron), always considering reads orientation. To obtain proxies for the	
relative concentrations of exonic and intronic gene products, read counts were	
thereafter normalized by the total library sizes, as well as by the total sizes of the	
respective intronic or exonic regions. Log2 expression levels were calculated.	
5′-TOP analysis. A transcriptional start site sequencing (TSS-Seq) dataset from	
embryonic (17 d) mouse was downloaded from DBTSS (version 10) (79). TSS	
clusters were filtered for “confident” tag pattern, “NM_correspond” tag	
type, and a minimum of 10 tags. The field “Represent TSS position” was used	
to define the genomic position of each TSS. For each TSS, we searched in the	
region [−5,+20] for a pyrimidine repeat of at least 5 nt starting before the	
8th nt from the TSS and with a ratio of [T] and [C] less than 0.8. Enrichment	
was performed using a hypergeometric test.	
TISU analysis. TSSs are defined as for the 5′-TOP analysis. We scanned, using	
fuzznuc (80), the region [−5,+45] around each TSS for the consensus sequence “[CG]AA[CG]ATGGCGG,” allowing one or two mismatches. Enrichment was performed using a hypergeometric test.	
Gene ontology analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using	
RDAVIDWebService (81). Enrichment test was performed for Biological	
Process (BP_all) and KEGG pathway annotation. Categories with adjusted	
P values (Benjamini–Hochberg) smaller than 0.05 and a total population count	
between 5 and 700 were reported.	
Translation efficiency. The ratio between RFP and exonic RNA-Seq expression levels	
can be used as a proxy for translation efficiency. To avoid possible bias generated by	
our experimental design (single-end RFP reads versus paired-ends RNA-Seq reads),	
RNA-Seq sequences were fragmented in silico using a custom Perl script: For each	
first read in the pair, a substring with a size sampled from a normal distribution	
(mean = 33, SD = 2) was extracted starting at a random position. The resulting	
fragmented RNA-Seq (FRS) reads were then aligned and quantified using the same	
pipeline as for the ribosome footprints (except for the adapter trimming option).	
Changes in translation efficiency between WT and Bmal1 KO conditions were	
computed using the edgeR (82) generalized linear model framework. RFP and FRS	
counts (unique mapping reads) were normalized using edgeR. To estimate differential translation efficiency in edgeR, conditional (WT, KO) and experimental	
(RFP, FRS) factors were introduced together with an interaction term, whose significance is assessed with a likelihood ratio test. Genes with FDR smaller than 0.05	
and absolute Log2 fold change larger than 0.5 were analyzed.	
Rhythmicity analysis. For ALF (2-h resolution) and RF (4-h resolution) conditions,	
we focused on 24 h/12 h and 24 h periodicity, respectively, using harmonic	
regression on the log2 transformed signals yðtÞ. We used the relation	
yðtÞ = μ + α cosðð2π=TÞ  tÞ +   β  sinðð2π=TÞtÞ + noise, where μ is the mean and α	
and β are the coefficients of cosine and sine functions with period T. To	
facilitate the comparison of rhythmicity between different types of signals	
(RFP or RNA-Seq) and conditions (e.g., genotypes or feeding), we used a	
model selection approach. In the case of N conditions, we allowed α and β to	
be either zero (no rhythm) or nonzero (rhythms), and, moreover, α and β	
could be shared between any subset of the N conditions. In short, a gene	
could thus be flat or rhythmic and share its phase and amplitude with any other	
conditions. The number of resulting models for N conditions is given by the Bell	
number BN+1 (83). Each model is solved using standard linear regression and the	
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used to control for model complexity (84).	
BIC = n  lnðRSS=nÞ +   k  lnðnÞ, with RSS the sum of residuals square of the multilinear regression, n the number of time points, and k the numbers of parameters. Confidence in the models can be addressed using Schwarz weights:	
wj =   e	
1	
2 ΔBICj=P	
Me	
1	
2 ΔBICm	
where ΔBICj = BICj −  BICm*, with m* the minimum	
BIC value in the set of BN+1 models. wj can be interpreted as the probability	
that j is the optimal model (in the BIC sense) given the data and the set of	
candidate models.	
Total Protein Extraction and Analysis. Frozen livers were homogenized in lysis	
buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF,	
1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mM	
spermin, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1 mM DTT, and a protease inhibitor mixture. After	
incubation 30 min on ice, extracts were centrifuged 10 min at 21,000 × g and the	
supernatants were harvested to obtain total extracts. Twenty micrograms of	
extract were used for Western blotting. After migration, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and Western blotting was realized according to	
standard procedures using antibodies (Cell Signaling) raised against P-RPS6	
(2211), RPS6 (2117), and P-RAPTOR (2083) proteins.

Phototransduction by Retinal	
Ganglion Cells That Set the	
Circadian Clock	
David M. Berson,* Felice A. Dunn,† Motoharu Takao†	
Light synchronizes mammalian circadian rhythms with environmental time by	
modulating retinal input to the circadian pacemaker—the suprachiasmatic	
nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Such photic entrainment requires neither	
rods nor cones, the only known retinal photoreceptors. Here, we show that	
retinal ganglion cells innervating the SCN are intrinsically photosensitive. Unlike other ganglion cells, they depolarized in response to light even when all	
synaptic input from rods and cones was blocked. The sensitivity, spectral tuning,	
and slow kinetics of this light response matched those of the photic entrainment	
mechanism, suggesting that these ganglion cells may be the primary photoreceptors for this system.	
The SCN is the circadian pacemaker of the	
mammalian brain, driving daily cycles in activity, hormonal levels, and other physiological variables. Light can phase-shift the endogenous oscillator in the SCN, synchronizing it with the environmental day-night cycle.	
This process, the photic entrainment of circadian rhythms, originates in the eye and involves a direct axonal pathway from a small	
fraction of retinal ganglion cells to the SCN	
(1–3). A striking feature of this neural circuit	
is its apparent independence from conventional retinal phototransduction. In functionally blind transgenic mice lacking virtually	
all known photoreceptors (rods and cones),	
photic entrainment persists with undiminished sensitivity (4). Candidate photoreceptors for this system are nonrod, noncone retinal neurons, including some ganglion cells,	
that contain novel opsins or cryptochromes	
(5–8).	
To determine whether retinal ganglion	
cells innervating the SCN are capable of phototransduction, we labeled them in the rat	
retina by retrograde transport of fluorescent	
microspheres injected into the hypothalamus	
(9). In isolated retinas, whole-cell recordings	
were made of the responses of labeled ganglion cells to light (10) (Fig. 1, A to E). In	
most of these cells (n 5 150), light evoked	
large depolarizations with superimposed fast	
action potentials (Fig. 1, E to G) (11). The	
light response persisted during bath application of 2 mM cobalt chloride (Fig. 1F; n 5	
42), which blocks calcium-mediated synaptic	
release from rods, cones, and other retinal	
neurons (12). In contrast, other ganglion cells	
prepared and recorded under identical conditions but not selectively labeled from the	
SCN (control cells) lacked detectable response to light even without synaptic blockade (47/50 cells; Fig. 1, I and J) (13). This is	
presumably because rod and cone photopigments were extensively bleached (10). A few	
control cells (3/50) exhibited weak, evanescent responses to light, but these were abolished by bath-applied cobalt (n 5 2).	
To ensure blockade of conventional synaptic influences from rods and cones, we	
supplemented cobalt with a mixture of drugs	
that independently disrupted both the glutamatergic synapses crucial to vertical signal	
transfer through the retina and the ionotropic	
receptors responsible for most inhibitory influences on ganglion cells (14). Robust light	
responses persisted in SCN-projecting ganglion cells under these conditions (Fig. 1G;	
n 5 7). Furthermore, the somata of these	
ganglion cells exhibited photosensitivity even	
when completely detached from the retina by	
microdissection (Fig. 1H; n 5 3). These light	
responses were not an artifact of photic excitation of either of the intracellular fluorophores we used, as the action spectrum of the	
light response (Fig. 2C) differed from the	
absorption spectra of both the retrograde tracer and Lucifer Yellow (LY) used for intracellular staining. Also, light-evoked increases in	
spike frequency were detectable in extracellular recordings, before patch rupture and LY	
dye filling (n 5 5). Whole-cell recordings	
revealed normal light responses when LY	
was omitted from the internal solution (n 5	
8). In contrast, control cells lacked cobaltresistant light responses even when labeled	
with both fluorescent beads and LY (n 5 12;	
Fig. 1I). These data indicate that retinal ganglion cells innervating the SCN are intrinsically photosensitive.	
To determine if these cells could serve as	
the primary photoreceptors for circadian entrainment, we assessed congruence between	
their photic properties and those of the entrainment mechanism. The responses of a single cell	
to narrow-band stimuli of various intensities	
showed that at each wavelength, peak depolarization increased with stimulus energy (Fig. 2,	
A and B). Intensity-response curves exhibited a	
consistent slope when plotted in semilogarithmic coordinates (Fig. 2B), as expected for responses mediated by a single photopigment	
(principle of univariance). The horizontal displacements of the curves from one another reflect the spectral dependence of the pigment’s	
quantum efficiency and yield the spectral sensitivity function shown in Fig. 2C (red curve).	
Other cells exhibited similar action spectra (Fig.	
2C, green curve) (15). These action spectra	
closely matched that predicted for a retinal1based pigment with peak sensitivity at 484 nm	
(Fig. 2C, black). They also resemble action	
spectra derived behaviorally for circadian entrainment in rodents (16, 17), as expected if	
these ganglion cells function as primary	
circadian	
photoreceptors	
(18).	
Judging	
from available spectral evidence, the photopigment in these ganglion cells is more	
likely to be a retinaldehyde-based opsin	
such as melanopsin (5, 19, 20) than a flavin-based cryptochrome (21).

The threshold and dynamic range of the	
light response in these ganglion cells were	
also similar to those of the entrainment mechanism. Threshold retinal irradiance for a fullfield stimulus was about 5 3 1011 photons	
s21 cm22 at 500 nm (;lmax; n 5 3) . This	
corresponds to an in vivo corneal irradiance	
of ;2 3 1013 photons s21 cm22, comparable	
to thresholds for circadian phase shifts in	
rodents (;1010 to 1013 photons s21 cm22 at	
500 nm) (22–24) and to ocular illumination	
by the dawn sky. Response saturation in photosensitive ganglion cells occurred at irradiances ;3 logarithmic units above threshold	
(Figs. 2B and 3C), matching the dynamic	
range of entrainment behavior (16, 23, 24)	
and many SCN neurons [(25), but see (26)].	
The circadian entrainment mechanism integrates light energy over very long time	
scales, exhibits little adaptation, and responds	
poorly to brief stimuli (24, 27). Similar features were evident in the behavior of photosensitive ganglion cells. Constant illumination depolarized cells tonically and elevated	
spike frequency, and the amount of depolarization was monotonically related to stimulus	
energy (Fig. 3). Response kinetics were much	
slower than typical for ganglion cells. Latencies to response onset (Vm . 3 standard deviations above baseline) were typically several seconds and ranged from several hundred	
milliseconds for saturating stimuli (Figs. 1F	
and 2A) to ;1 min near threshold (Fig. 3B,	
bottom trace). Latencies from stimulus onset	
to peak depolarization were typically 10 to	
20 s (range: ;2 s to 2 min) and inversely

related to stimulus energy. Repolarization after intense stimuli required several minutes	
and was sometimes punctuated by spontaneous depolarizations and spike bursts lasting	
up to a minute each (Fig. 3B).	
Photosensitive ganglion cells shared a common morphology (Fig. 4, A and B), as revealed	
by intracellular staining with LY (28). Somata	
were intermediate in diameter among neurons	
of the ganglion cell layer (14.7 6 1.2 mm,	
mean 6 SD; n 5 18). Many cells sent an axon	
into the optic fiber layer; those lacking one had	
presumably lost it during mechanical exposure	
of the soma before recording. The sparsely	
branching, tortuous dendrites of these cells arborized primarily in the outer part (OFF sublayer) of the inner plexiform layer (IPL; Fig.	
4B). Although some dendrites coursed within	
the inner IPL (ON sublayer) for 100 to 200 mm,	
nearly all terminated in the OFF sublayer. Such	
stratification is highly unusual for ganglion	
cells depolarized by light [but see (29, 30)].	
Dendritic fields were large (diameter 497 6	
115 mm; mean 6 SD; n 5 21). Stimuli illuminating the dendrites but not the soma consistently evoked light responses (31). Control	
cells, which lacked cobalt-resistant light responses, had markedly different dendritic morphology (e.g., Fig. 4C).	
These data identify a distinct ganglion cell	
type in the mammalian retina with characteristic dendritic profile and stratification pattern, extraordinarily sluggish and tonic light	
responses encoding ambient light level, and	
axonal projections to the SCN. The most	
striking feature of this cell type, however, is	
its apparent capacity for intrinsic phototransduction. The correspondences between the	
photic properties of these cells and those of	
the entrainment mechanism suggest that these	
unconventional ganglion cells may represent	
the primary photoreceptors for synchronizing	
the circadian clock to environmental time.	
Melanopsin (5, 7) is probably the photopigment responsible for the intrinsic sensitivity of	
these cells to light, as it is selectively expressed	
in the small subset of ganglion cells that are	
intrinsically photosensitive and innervate the	
SCN (32, 33). In amphibians, certain nonretinal	
cells contain melanopsin, and these cells, too,	
are photosensitive, with action spectra resembling those of photosensitive rat ganglion cells	
(Fig. 2C) (5, 19, 20). Melanopsin exhibits	
marked sequence similarity to invertebrate	
opsins (5, 7), which, unlike vertebrate opsins,	
retain	
their	
photoisomerized	
retinaldehyde	
chromophore and typically trigger depolarizing	
light responses when activated. These properties may help to explain why photosensitive	
ganglion cells differ from conventional retinal	
photoreceptors in their response polarity and	
lack of dependence on the pigment epithelium.	
Cryptochromes, blue-light–absorbing, flavinbased pigments, have been proposed as circadian photopigments (8), but spectral evidence	
(Fig. 2C) (21) weighs against their mediating	
the light response in intrinsically photosensitive	
ganglion cells.	
Note added in proof: Further evidence for	
the presence of melanopsin in ganglion cells	
innervating the SCN has emerged (34).

Disruption of Circadian Insulin Secretion Is	
Associated With Reduced Glucose Uptake in 	
First-Degree Relatives of Patients With 	
Type 2 Diabetes	
Guenther Boden, Xinhua Chen, and Marcia Polansky	
The objective of this study was to evaluate whether	
first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with type 2 diabetes had abnormal circadian insulin secretion and, if	
so, whether this abnormality affected their glucose	
metabolism. Six African-American FDRs with normal	
glucose tolerance and 12 matched normal control subjects (who had no family history of diabetes) were	
exposed to 48 h of hyperglycemic clamping (~12 m m o l / l ) .	
Insulin secretion rates (ISRs) were determined by	
deconvolution of plasma C-peptide levels using individual C-peptide kinetic parameters. Detrending and	
smoothing of data (z-scores) and computation of autocorrelation functions were used to identify ISR cycles.	
During the initial hours after start of glucose infusions,	
ISRs were ~60% higher in FDRs than in control subjects	
(585 vs. 366 nmol/16 h, P < 0.05), while rates of glucose	
uptake were the same (5.6 mmol · kg– 1 · h– 1), indicating	
that the FDRs were insulin resistant. Control subjects	
had well-defined circadian (24 h) cycles of ISR and	
plasma insulin that rose in the early morning, peaked in	
the afternoon, and declined during the night. In contrast, FDRs had several shorter ISR cycles of smaller	
amplitude that lacked true periodicity. This suggested	
that the lack of a normal circadian ISR increase had	
made it impossible for the FDRs to maintain their compensatory insulin hypersecretion beyond 18 h of hyperglycemia. As a result, ISR decreased to the level found	
in control subjects, and glucose uptake fell below the	
level of control subjects (61 vs. 117 µmol · kg– 1 · min– 1,	
P < 0.05). In summary, we found that FDRs with normal	
glucose tolerance had defects in insulin action and	
secretion. The newly recognized insulin secretory	
defect consisted of disruption of the normal circadian	
ISR cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion	
(and glucose uptake) during the ascending part of the	
24 h ISR cycle. D i a b e t e s 4 8 :2 1 8 2–2188, 1999	
F	
irst-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with type	
2 diabetes develop diabetes at a greater rate than	
the normal population (1–3) and have been used to	
uncover early abnormalities that may be important	
in the development of type 2 diabetes. For instance, several	
studies have shown that in glucose-tolerant FDRs, defects in	
insulin action precede defects in insulin secretion (1,4–8). Others, however, have shown the opposite: namely, defects in	
insulin secretion preceding defects in insulin action (9).	
Hence, the question remains unsettled as to whether insulin	
resistance or insulin deﬁciency is the primary pathogenetic	
event in type 2 diabetes.	
We have recently demonstrated that normal subjects have	
circadian (24 h) cycles of insulin secretion and plasma insulin	
levels (rising in the early morning, peaking in the afternoon,	
and declining during the night) (10), which were different	
from the earlier recognized short (10–14 min) and longer (1–3	
h) pulsatile cycles of insulin secretion (11–13). These circadian	
cycles of insulin secretion rate (ISR) and plasma insulin levels were absent in patients with type 2 diabetes (14). It is currently not known whether the absence of circadian ISR cycles	
in type 2 diabetes is a secondary phenomenon, i.e., a consequence of the multiple metabolic and hormonal abnormalities	
of type 2 diabetes, or whether it is a primary, and perhaps	
p a t h o p h y s i o l o g i c a l l y, important phenomenon.	
The goal of this study was, therefore, to determine	
whether FDRs have abnormal circadian insulin secretion	
and, if so, whether this could affect their glucose metabolism.	
To this end, we have measured ISR and glucose uptake rates	
during 48 h of hyperglycemic clamping in FDRs with normal	
glucose tolerance and in matched normal control subjects.	
Hyperglycemia was used because it facilitates recognition of	
circadian ISR periodicity (10).	
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS	
S u b j e c t s . We have studied six African-American FDRs. Of these, four had one and	
the other two had two parents with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we have studied	
12 African-American control subjects without a family history of diabetes. The control subjects were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 8) was matched for sex,	
weight, and age with the FDRs. Group 2 (n = 4) was matched with FDRs for sex,	
weight, and age, as well as for ISR (Table 1). All study subjects had normal oral	
glucose tolerance tests (Fig. 1); none were taking any medications or participated	
in regular exercise programs. Their weights were stable for at least 2 months, and	
their diets contained a minimum of 250 g of carbohydrate for at least 2 days before	
the studies. The purpose, nature, and potential risks of the study were explained

Experimental design. All subjects were admitted to Temple University Hospit a l ’s General Clinical Research Center on the morning of the studies and received	
a standard breakfast at ~9:00 A M. To test the effects of hyperglycemia on insulin	
secretion and action, hyperglycemic clamps (~12 mmol/l) were started between	
1:00 and 2:00 P M and continued for 48 h. A short polyethylene catheter was	
inserted into an antecubital vein for infusion of test substances. Another catheter	
was placed into a contralateral forearm vein for blood sampling. This arm was	
wrapped with a heating blanket (~70°C) to arterialize venous blood.	
Hyperglycemic clamps. A 20% glucose solution was infused at variable rates	
calculated to maintain plasma glucose at ~12 mmol/l. Plasma glucose was monitored, and infusion rates were adjusted every hour, or more frequently when	
needed. The patients fasted but were allowed to drink water. Plasma electrolytes	
were monitored every 6 h, body weight every 12 h, and ﬂuid balance every 6 h.	
Fluid balance was maintained with infusion of normal saline. Potassium and magnesium were added to the glucose infusions as needed to maintain normal	
plasma concentrations. Blood samples were collected every 30 min for the initial 2 h of glucose infusion and every 2 h thereafter for measurement of glucose,	
insulin, and C-peptide.	
C-peptide kinetic studies. C-peptide kinetics, needed to calculate insulin secretory rates, were determined several days before the studies. An intravenous	
bolus of 50 nmol of biosynthetic human C-peptide (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) was	
administered to each subject after an overnight fast, and plasma C-peptide was	
measured at frequent intervals for 3 h as described by Polonsky et al. (13) and Va n	
Cauter et al. (15). Individual kinetic parameters of C-peptide clearance were	
determined by analysis of the C-peptide decay curves.	
I S R s . The C-peptide kinetic parameters were used to calculate insulin secretory	
rates during the hyperglycemic period by deconvolution of peripheral C-peptide	
concentrations according to Polonsky et al. (16). Plasma volume was assumed	
to be 4.1% of ideal body weight plus 1% of excess body weight (17).	
Determination of diurnal ISR cycles. ISR data were converted to detrended	
z-scores using robust biweight regression (18).	
Detrended z-scores were calculated as (ISR – ISRp r e d i c t e d) / S Dregression, w h e r e	
I S Rp r e d i c t e d equals ISR from the ISR versus time regression and SDr e g r e s s i o n e q u a l s	
the standard deviation of the regression line. The autocorrelation function (A) was	
determined separately for each subject as A(T) = e C(t) · C(t + T)dt, where C i s	
normalized data points, t is the time, and T the lag time of the correlation (19), and	
was used to determine ISR periodicity. Measurements were smoothed using	
splines (20). Regression analysis with ISR as the dependent variable, the cosine	
of time (with periodicity set to 24 h) as the independent variable (21), and ﬁr s t order autocorrelated errors was performed for each subject.	
Glucose turnover. Glucose turnover was determined by isotope dilution analysis before (0 h) and after 24 h of hyperglycemia. After a bolus of 30 µmol/kg,	
[ 6 , 6-2H2]glucose was infused intravenously for 2 h at a rate of 0.3 µmol · kg– 1 · min– 1.	
Glucose was isolated from blood drawn at –90, 0, and 30 min for determination of	
isotope enrichment by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Model 4610-B;	
Finnigan Mat, San Jose, CA) (22). Rates of glucose appearance and disappearance	
were calculated from the isotope enrichment with Steele’s equation for	
non–steady state conditions (23). Underestimation of glucose appearance rates during hyperglycemia was avoided by adding [6,6-2H2]glucose to the unlabeled glucose	
infused to maintain hyperglycemia (24). In addition, the rate of glucose infused to	
maintain the glucose clamp (GIR) was used as an estimation of glucose uptake.	
Analytical procedures. Plasma glucose was measured with a glucose analyzer	
with the glucose oxidase method; serum free insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay after polyethylene glycol precipitation using an antiserum with minimal (<0.2%) cross-reactivity with proinsulin and with des-31,32-proinsulin (Linco	
Research, St. Charles, MO); C-peptide was determined by radioimmunoassay	
with an antiserum that cross-reacted <4% with proinsulin (Linco); and proinsulin was determined with an antiserum that cross-reacted 95% with des-31,32human proinsulin and <0.1% with des-64,65-human proinsulin, C-peptide, and	
insulin (Linco). Electrolytes were measured at Temple University Hospital’s	
Chemistry Laboratory.	
Statistical analysis. All data were expressed as means ± SE. Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using analysis of variance and Student’s two-tailed t test when	
indicated. The variations in ISR and insulin concentration with time were analyzed	
by repeated measures analysis of variance with the SAS program (SAS Institute,	
C a r y, NC). The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the median autocorrelations	
of FDR and control subjects and to test for the signiﬁcance of the median of the	
coefficients of the cosine function of time.

Basal glucose and insulin levels. Basal plasma glucose	
concentrations were 4.8 ± 0.2 mmol/l in control subjects and	
4.8 ± 0.2 mmol/l in FDRs (NS). Basal serum insulin concentrations were 36 ± 6 pmol/l in control subjects and 60 ±	
6 pmol/l in FDRs (P < 0.05). Basal C-peptide concentrations	
were 0.40 ± 0.06 nmol/l in control subjects and 0.62 ± 0.10	
nmol/l in FDRs (P < 0.05). The basal hyperinsulinemia in	
FDRs suggested basal insulin resistance.	
Insulin secretion during hyperglycemia. Glucose concentrations during the 48-h glucose infusion were the same	
in FDR and control subjects (11.8 ± 0.2 and 12.0 ± 0.3 mmol/l,	
r e s p e c t i v e l y, NS) (Fig. 2A). During the initial 2 h of hyperglycemia (from 2:00 to 4:00 P M), ISR rose from 67 ± 9 to 442	
± 54 pmol/min (P < 0.01) in control subjects and from 94 ± 19	
to 736 ± 143 pmol/min (P < 0.01) in FDRs. During the initial	
16–18 h of hyperglycemia, areas under the ISR curves (AUC	
ISR) were ~60% larger in FDR than in control subjects (585	
± 98 vs. 366 ± 60 nmol/16 h, P < 0.05).	
Between 18 and 24 h, ISR remained essentially unchanged	
in FDRs but rose in control subjects as part of their normal	
2 4-h cycle so that at 24 h, ISRs were the same in control subjects and FDRs (Fig. 2B). Between 24 and 48 h, ISRs slowly	
declined in FDRs, while in control subjects, ISRs ﬁr s t	
declined and then started to rise again.

ABNORMALINSULIN SECRETION IN FIRST-DEGREE RELATIVES	
Peripheral insulin concentrations followed closely the	
course of ISRs, rising in response to intravenous glucose and	
attaining higher concentrations in FDR than in control subjects during the initial 16–18 h (AUC insulin 22.7 ± 2.4 vs. 14.4	
± 2.5 nmol · l– 1 · 16 h– 1, P < 0.05), then reaching equal concentrations between 18 and 24 h and declining together	
between 24 and 48 h (Fig. 2C) .	
The inability of FDRs to raise their ISR after 18 h of hyperglycemia could have been a consequence of unsustainably	
high ISR. We, therefore, tested four control subjects (Table 1,	
group 2) whose mean initial ISRs (from 2 to 18 h) were as high	
as those of the FDRs (511 ± 35 vs. 479 ± 26 pmol/min). In contrast to the FDRs, ISR in these control subjects had a normal	
circadian increase, starting at ~18 h, demonstrating that ISR	
in the 600–800 pmol/min range did not disrupt their circadian	
insulin secretion (Fig. 3).	
Glucose uptake. GIR, reﬂecting insulin plus glucose-stimulated glucose uptake, were the same during the initial 18 h of	
hyperglycemia in control subjects and FDRs (AUC GIR 5.6 ±	
0.3 vs. 5.6 ± 0.6 mmol · kg– 1 · h– 1). When the ISR became	
equal in FDR and control subjects between 18 and 24 h, GIR	
in FDRs started to decline relative to control subjects and	
remained lower in FDR than control subjects between 24	
and 48 h (AUC GIR 4.13 ± 0.45 vs. 3.16 ± 0.5 mmol · kg– 1 · h– 1,	
P < 0.05) (Fig. 2D) .	
Rates of isotopically determined glucose disappearance	
(GR d) (the calculation of which, unlike GIR, is not affected	
by residual endogenous glucose production) were similar	
( 7 2 ± 9 vs. 80 ± 4 µmol · kg– 1 · min– 1, NS) in control subjects	
and FDRs, respectively, after ~1 h of hyperglycemia. After	
2 4 h of hyperglycemia, however, GR d was higher in control	
subjects than in FDRs (117 ± 6 vs. 61 ± 6 µmol · kg– 1 · min– 1,	
P < 0.05), conﬁrming the presence of uncompensated insulin	
resistance in FDRs.	
Circadian rhythmicity of ISR. The temporal pattern of	
ISR was markedly different in FDR and control subjects. In	
control subjects, ISR started to rise in the early morning	
hours, peaked in the early afternoon, and then declined to	
reach a nadir between 2:00 and 6:00 A M the next day (Figs. 2	
and 4). The ISR pattern in FDRs was irregular, the detrended	
data showing several peaks of smaller amplitude and shorter	
duration that more or less disappeared upon smoothing (Fig.	
4, upper a n d middle panels). This abnormal pattern of ISR	
was seen in all six FDRs (Fig. 5).	
The ﬁrst-order autocorrelation function in control subjects was positive for lags of 1–4 h, then became negative for	
lags of 4–16 h, and after that reverted to become positive	
again, suggesting a periodicity of ~24 h. The cosine function	
of time in the regression model was highly signiﬁcant (P <	
0.001), conﬁrming periodicity of ISR (Fig. 4, lower panel). In	
contrast, there was no clear periodicity in FDRs. Mean ﬁr s t FIG. 2. Plasma glucose and insulin levels and ISRs and GIRs during 48 h

control subjects (s). A: Glucose; B: ISR; C: insulin; D: GIR.

order autocorrelation in FDRs was close to 0, indicating that	
there were short-term ﬂuctuations in ISR over 2-h periods (P =	
0.01 for the difference in short-term ISR ﬂuctuations between	
relatives and control subjects). The 24-h autocorrelation was	
also close to 0, and the autocorrelation function did not have	
a wave-like appearance, which indicated that there was no	
true 24-h periodicity. Similar results were obtained with	
plasma insulin levels (data not shown).	
Plasma cortisol and melatonin. Cortisol and melatonin	
concentrations were determined during one full 24-h cycle to	
test whether these hormones had maintained their normal circadian rhythmicity. Cortisol and melatonin levels both rose,	
peaked, and declined similarly in normal control subjects	
and FDRs (Fig. 6).	
P r o i n s u l i n . To assess whether hyperglycemic stress could	
have caused a dysfunction in the processing of proinsulin to	
insulin, plasma proinsulin and proinsulin-to-insulin ratios	
were measured serially. Basal proinsulin concentrations	
were 6.0 ± 2.1 pmol/l in control subjects and 12.0 ± 1.5 pmol/l	
in FDRs (P < 0.05). Basal molar proinsulin-to-insulin ratios	
were 0.15 ± 0.04 in control subjects and 0.21 ± 0.03 in FDRs	
(NS). During hyperglycemia, proinsulin rose in both groups,	
stabilizing at ~50–60 pmol/l in control subjects and at	
~110–120 pmol/l in FDRs. The proinsulin-to-insulin ratios	
decreased initially during glucose infusion (P < 0.05) (from	
0.15 ± 0.04 to 0.04 ± 02 in control subjects and from 0.21 ± 0.03	
to 0.06 ± 0.007 in FDRs, P < 0.05) and subsequently rose in	
both groups, approaching basal rates at the end of the studies (0.13 ± 0.08 and 0.16 ± 0.03 at 44 h). At no time were	
proinsulin-to-insulin ratios in control subjects and FDRs	
s i g n i ﬁcantly different from each other (Fig. 7).

Disrupted circadian insulin secretion in FDRs. The normal control subjects in this study exhibited well-deﬁned 24h (circadian) cycles of ISR and insulin levels, rising in the early	
morning hours, peaking in the early afternoon, and declining	
during the night, conﬁrming previous ﬁndings (10). In contrast,	
all six FDRs had no circadian cycles of ISR (or of insulin), but	
instead had several irregular and shorter ISR cycles that	
lacked true periodicity (Figs. 4 and 5). Similar results were	
obtained when plasma insulin levels were analyzed (data not	
shown). The cause for the abnormal patterns of ISR and	
insulin in FDRs is not known. Numerous publications, howe v e r, have demonstrated a strong relationship between the	
light/dark cycle, plasma melatonin levels, a robust marker of	
circadian light/dark periodicity (25,26), and circadian biorhythms, including those associated with blood pressure,	
core body temperature, and plasma cortisol levels (27,28).

ABNORMALINSULIN SECRETION IN FIRST-DEGREE RELATIVES	
synaptically connect the retina with suprachiasmatic nuclei	
in the hypothalamus, are the principal pacemakers of circadian periodicity and that their linkage with the retina mediates the synchronization with the light/dark cycle (28). We	
have, therefore, measured plasma cortisol and melatonin levels in an attempt to determine whether the abnormal ISR	
rhythmicity was caused by a central nervous system or a	
b-cell defect. The ﬁnding of normal circadian patterns of	
plasma cortisol and melatonin levels in FDRs (Fig. 6) suggested that the defect may have been located in their b- c e l l s .	
It is interesting that irregularities of pulsatile insulin secretion have been observed previously in FDRs (29). However,	
since the FDRs in that study were already glucose intolerant,	
it was not clear whether these pulsatile secretory abnormalities were of primary or secondary nature. Seen in light of the	
present ﬁndings, however, they suggest that there may be a	
fundamental disturbance of all types of cyclic insulin secretion in FDRs.	
The disrupted circadian ISR pattern reduced insulin secretion and glucose uptake. Initially, b-cells of FDRs seemed to	
function appropriately in response to the acute rise in plasma	
glucose, secreting a greater than normal amount of insulin to	
compensate for the underlying insulin resistance. This	
changed after ~16–18 h, when ISRs rose in control subjects as	
part of their normal 24 h cycles, while ISRs in FDRs either did	
not change or declined. By ~24 h, ISR (and plasma insulin) were	
the same in FDR and control subjects and glucose uptake in	
FDRs had begun to fall below that of control subjects (Fig. 2).	
Thus, the absence of a cyclic ISR rise in FDRs at that time	
appeared to have been responsible for the loss of compensatory	
insulin oversecretion and the decrease in glucose uptake.	
It could be argued that the inability of FDRs to raise their	
ISR after 18 h was due to the fact that their ISRs were already	
very high and could not be raised further. In other words, the	
same would have occurred in normal control subjects, had	
their initial ISRs been equally as high as those of the FDRs.

This possibility seems rather unlikely, since we have demonstrated that a group of normal control subjects who had ISRs	
as high as the initial ISRs of FDRs were able to maintain	
their normal circadian ISR cycles for >24 h (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be excluded that the FDRs	
had a reduced b-cell mass (30) and that because of that,	
secreting the same amount of insulin as control subjects presented increased secretory stress.	
The reason that FDRs were able to maintain higher ISR than	
control subjects during the initial 16–18 h is not clear. It could	
have been due to the fact that in control subjects, ISR	
declined during most of this period as part of their normal 24-h	
ISR cycle. Alternatively, it is possible that 18 h of hyperglycemia had somehow exhausted the b-cells in FDRs (31).	
To explore possible reasons for the b-cell dysfunction in	
FDRs, we considered the possibility that the prolonged	
hyperglycemia had placed an increased demand on proinsulin	
processing, which may have become dysfunctional (32). This	
seemed reasonable because of reports that patients with	
type 2 diabetes have disproportionally elevated plasma levels of proinsulin and its conversion intermediates, suggesting	
that the processing of proinsulin to insulin was perturbed	
(33–35). If this was the case in FDRs, one would expect to see	
accumulation of proinsulin and its most abundant intermediate metabolite, des-31,32-proinsulin (33,36). This, however,	
was not the case. Plasma proinsulin (which included des31,32-proinsulin) was only ~6% of plasma insulin during the	
ﬁrst 6 h of hyperglycemia and the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio	
was similar in FDR and control subjects at all times (Fig. 7).	
The slow increase in the proinsulin-to-insulin ratios, which	
occurred throughout hyperglycemia in both groups, was	
probably caused by the longer half-life of proinsulin compared	
with insulin (37), which resulted in accumulation of proinsulin	
(and des-31,32-proinsulin) in the blood. Hence, our studies did	
not support the notion that prolonged hyperglycemia in	
FDRs had interfered with processing of proinsulin to insulin.	
L a s t l y, it is necessary to consider what role glucose toxicity/desensitization (38) may have played in the abnormal	
b-cell function in FDRs. We have previously shown in normal	
control subjects that the same degree of hyperglycemia as	
that used here (i.e., ~12 mmol/l) inhibited glucose uptake as	
well as insulin secretion, i.e., produced glucose toxicity after	
~35–40 h (39). Therefore, interpretation of ISR and GIR data	
after ~35 h of hyperglycemia in this study is complicated by	
the development of glucose toxicity/desensitization. On the	
other hand, it is conceivable that b-cells of FDRs were more	
susceptible than those of control subjects to glucose toxicity/desensitization and that, therefore, glucose desensitization may have been responsible for some of the b-cell dysfunction in FDRs.	
Clinical relevance. Here, we have demonstrated an insulin	
secretory defect in insulin-resistant FDRs. The defect consisted of a disruption of the normal circadian insulin secretion cycle that resulted in subnormal insulin secretion (and	
glucose uptake) because of absence of the ascending part of	
the 24-h ISR cycle. The insulin secretory defect was demonstrated under conditions of prolonged hyperglycemia.	
Whether it also affects insulin secretion under everyday living conditions and whether our ﬁndings apply to a larger	
population of FDRs remains to be shown. The fact that the	
FDRs all had normal oral glucose tolerance tests does not rule	
out that the defect in circadian insulin secretion may play an	
important role in the development of glucose intolerance in	
FDRs. First, the glucose tolerance tests were done near the	
nadir (8:00–9:00 A M) of the ISR cycle, i.e., at a time when one	
would not expect to ﬁnd differences between FDR and control subjects. In addition, there is some evidence that the	
secretory defect is progressing from a disrupted (this study)	
to a completely absent (14) circadian ISR cycle.

Evidence for a Circadian Rhythm of Insulin Sensitivity	
in Patients With NIDDM Caused by Cyclic Changes in	
Hepatic Glucose Production	
Guenther Boden, Xinhua Chen, and Jean Luc Urbain	
Diurnal variation in insulin sensitivity in patients with	
NIDDM has long been suspected but has been difficult	
to document mainly because of the interdependence of	
changes in glucose and insulin. Stable serum insulin	
levels during hyperglycemic clamping in patients with	
NIDDM in the present study provided the opportunity	
to examine changes in insulin sensitivity unaffected by	
changes in blood glucose and insulin concentrations.	
Six patients with NIDDM (four men and two women,	
BMI 33.9 ± 2.5) underwent hyperglycemic (11.1 mmol/1,	
—200 mg/dl) clamping for 72 h. Measured were serum	
insulin, free fatty acid (FFA), cortisol, and growth	
hormone concentrations and rates of insulin secretion,	
insulin clearance, and glucose infusion rate (GIR)	
needed to maintain hyperglycemia. In addition, five patients (three men and two women, BMI 32.6 ± 0.6)	
underwent hyperglycemic clamping for 24 h with hourly	
determinations of hepatic glucose production (HGP)	
and glucose disappearance rates (GRd). GIR, reflecting	
insulin sensitivity, changed rhythmically with a cycle	
duration of 22.9 ± 1.4 h and an amplitude of 47.8 ±	
11.2%. GIR was lowest at 8:31 a.m. (±52 min) and	
highest at 7:04 p.m. (±58 min). Circadian changes in	
GIR were completely accounted for by changes in HGP,	
while GRd remained unchanged. Plasma levels of FFAs	
and cortisol also exhibited circadian fluctuations, and	
their blood levels correlated negatively with GIR (r =	
-0.72 and -0.64, respectively). We concluded that	
insulin sensitivity in patients with NIDDM changed	
with circadian (—24 h) rhythmicity (decreasing during	
the night and increasing during the day). These changes	
were unrelated to blood levels of glucose and insulin,	
insulin clearance, exercise, food intake, and sleep.	
They were caused by circadian changes in HGP, which	
in turn were closely correlated with circadian changes	
in blood FFA and cortisol levels. We believe that recognition of these circadian changes has implications for	
the diagnosis and the treatment of patients with	
NIDDM. Diabetes 45:1044-1050, 1996

T	
he existence of diurnal variations in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in normal and diabetic	
subjects has been suspected for decades. The	
older literature contains numerous reports of diurnal changes in plasma glucose and in glucose tolerance (1).	
These reports, however, were often contradictory. Glucose	
tolerance was found to be better in the morning in some (2,3)	
and better in the afternoon in others (4,5). More recently,	
several groups have reported early morning increases in	
insulin requirements in patients with IDDM, which suggested	
an early morning decrease in insulin sensitivity or alternatively an increase in insulin clearance (6-8). The short	
duration of these studies (one night), however, did not permit recognition of diurnal changes. A major problem complicating studies of cyclic changes in insulin sensitivity has	
been the strong interdependence between glucose concentrations and insulin secretion (1). For instance, if there was	
a primary change in glucose concentration, it would produce	
an isodirectional change in insulin, which then would modify	
the glucose concentration. On the other hand, a primary	
change in insulin concentration would inversely affect glucose, which would then modify the insulin concentration.	
Because of this chicken-and-egg situation, it has remained	
uncertain whether or not there is a truly diurnal rhythm of	
insulin sensitivity in patients with IDDM or NIDDM.	
The findings in the present study that patients with	
NIDDM, in contrast to normal volunteers (9), have stable	
insulin levels during hyperglycemic clamping has allowed us	
to determine whether these patients have cyclic changes of	
insulin sensitivity unrelated to changes in blood glucose or	
insulin levels.	
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS	
Subjects. The clinical characteristics of the patients with NIDDM	
participating in these studies are shown in Table 1. All patients had been	
treated with sulfonylurea drugs, and five patients received in addition	
small doses of NPH insulin (5-15 U) at bedtime. Insulin and all other	
medications were discontinued at least 1 day before the studies. The	
patients' weights were stable for at least 2 months, and their diets	
contained a minimum of 250 g/day carbohydrate for at least 2 days	
before the studies. Informed written consent was obtained from all	
subjects after explanation of the nature, purpose, and potential risks of	
these studies. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional	
Review Board of Temple University Hospital.	
Experimental design. All patients were admitted to Temple University	
Hospital's General Clinical Research Center 1 day before the studies.	
The next morning after an overnight fast, a short polyethylene catheter	
was inserted into an antecubital vein for infusion of test substances.	
Another catheter was placed into a contralateral forearm vein for blood

sampling. This arm was wrapped with a heating blanket (~70°C) to	
arterialize venous blood. C-peptide was then infused to determine	
individual C-peptide kinetics. Between 5:00 and 6:00 P.M., the patients ate	
a standard dinner consisting of 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 30%	
fat. At midnight, glucose was clamped at the patients' prevailing blood	
glucose levels (isoglycemic clamp, —11.1 mmol/1) and continued for 72 h	
in five patients. In one patient, glucose was clamped for only 36 h. Blood	
samples were collected every 2 h for determination of hormones and	
substrates. One to two months later, three of the original six patients	
and two patients who had not been studied before were admitted to the	
General Clinical Research Center for a 24-h glucose turnover (GTO)	
study. After an overnight fast, their plasma glucose was clamped at	
—11.1 mmol/1, and blood was collected hourly for 24 h for determination	
of GTO rates.	
Procedures	
Hyperglycemic clamps. Six patients (four men and two women) were	
studied. A 5% glucose solution was infused at variable rates for 72 h to	
produce plasma glucose concentrations of —11.1 mmol/1. Blood samples	
were collected eveiy 10-15 min for the initial 4 h of glucose infusion,	
every 1 h thereafter for measurement of glucose, and every 2 h for	
determination of insulin, C-peptide, cortisol, growth hormone, free fatty	
acids (FFAs), and lactate. The patients fasted during the study, but were	
allowed to drink water. Bed rest was continued. Lights were turned off	
at 9:30 P.M. and turned on at 7:00 A.M. the next morning. Sleep was	
polygraphically monitored during one night. Plasma electrolytes, body	
weight, and fluid balance were monitored every 6 h. Fluid balance was	
maintained with infusion of normal saline. Potassium and magnesium	
were added to the glucose infusion as needed to maintain normal plasma	
concentrations.	
GTO. Five patients (three men and two women) were studied. GTO was	
determined with [3-3H]glucose. The tracer infusion (40 |xCi over 1 min	
followed by 0.4 |xCi/min) was started 90 min before the initiation of the	
measurements to ensure isotopical equilibration. Glucose was isolated	
from blood for determination of [3-3H]glucose specific activity as	
described (10). [3-3H]glucose specific activity remained stable throughout the 24-h studies. Rates of total body glucose appearance (GRJ and	
disappearance (GRd) were calculated using Steele's equation for steadystate conditions (11). GRtl values were corrected for urinary glucose	
"excretion (0.06 ± 0.007 |xmol • kg""1 • min""1). (GRa - urinary glucose"	
excretion = GRd.)	
Hepatic glucose production (HGP) was calculated as the difference	
between the isotopically determined GRa and the rates of glucose	
infusion needed to maintain hyperglycemia during the clamps.	
C-peptide kinetic studies. An intravenous bolus of 50 nmol of	
biosynthetic human C-peptide (Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) was administered	
to each subject after an overnight fast, and plasma C-peptide was	
measured at frequent intervals for 3 h as described by Van Cauter et al.	
(12). Individual C-peptide kinetic parameters were determined by analysis of the C-peptide decay curves. The C-peptide kinetic parameters	
were used to calculate the insulin secretory rates (ISRs) for each time	
interval between successive blood samples by deconvolution of peripheral C-peptide concentrations (12).	
Insulin clearance rates were determined for 6-h periods by dividing	
the areas under the ISR curves by the area under the serum insulin	
curves.	
Sleep recording. Sleep was monitored with a portable computerized	
polysomnographic system, (Alice 3, Healthdyne, Marietta, GA). The	
polygraphic records were scored visually at 30-s intervals in sleep stages	
1, 2, 3, 4, and rapid eye movement (REM) based on the criteria of	
Rechtshaffen and Kales (13).	
Determination of diurnal rhythms. To identify a rhythmic pattern,	
we applied a refined first-order Fourier transform to the respective	
curves of glucose infusion rate (GIR), cortisol, and FFAs. In a first step,	
data were normalized to their respective mean values. The autocorrelation function A(T) = f (C)(O • C(t + T) dt, where C is the normalized	
data points, t is the time, and T is the lag time of the correlation, then	
was applied to each set of normalized data. This function eliminates the	
background noise and the nonperiodical events in the defined time	
interval. The frequency (in cycles per 24 h) and the amplitude in the time	
domain (in percentage variation) of the cyclical phenomena, were then	
determined using the Fourier transform F(io) - At/ A(T) • cos • (ivT)	
dT, where iv is the pulsation frequency and A is the amplitude of the	
signal (14).	
Analytical procedures. Plasma glucose was measured with a glucose	
analyzer (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Serum-free insulin was determined	
by radioimmunoassay (RIA) after polyethylene glycol precipitation	
using an antiserum with minimal (<0.2%) cross-reactivity with proinsulin (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Human growth hormone (15) and glucagon	
(16) were determined by RIA. Cortisol was measured with a kit (Diagnostic, Los Angeles, CA). Plasma FFA concentration was determined	
with a kit from Wako (Richmond, VA). Lactate and alanine were	
measured enzymatically (17,18).	
Statistical analysis. All data are expressed as means ± SE. Statistical	
significance was assessed using analysis of variance and Student's	
two-tailed I test when indicated.	
RESULTS	
Glucose, insulin, insulin secretion, clearance, and GIR.	
Mean glucose concentration was 11.9 ± 0.4 mmol/1 (215 ± 7	
mg/dl) (coefficient of variation [CV] 5.8 ± 0.6%). Mean insulin	
concentration was 174 ± 18 pmol/1 (29 ± 3 (xU/ml). Individual serum insulin concentrations were stable throughout the	
studies in all six patients (Figs. 1 and 2). Mean ISR was 121 ±	
"23 pmol/min (0.01815 ± 0.00345 U/min or 0.18 mU-kg""1 •"	
"min""1), and mean insulin clearance was 0.75 ± 0.16 1/min"	
"(7.53 ml • kg""1 • min""1)."	
GIR reflected total body insulin sensitivity. Visual inspection of Fig. 1 showed a pulsatile rhythm of GIR. Fourier	
transform of the GIR data showed a cycle duration of 22.9 ±	
1.4 h and a mean amplitude (variation around the mean) of	
"47.8 ± 11.2% (± 3.8 ixmol • kg""1 • min""1). GIR was lowest in"	
the morning (8:31 A.M. [±52 min]) and highest in the evening	
(7:04 P.M. [±58 min]). The differences between trough and	
peak values were statistically significant for all 3 days (P <	
0.04, P < 0.01, and P < 0.01, respectively).	
Glucose production and utilization. Under steady-state	
conditions, GIR is determined by peripheral (muscle) glucose uptake (GRd) and HGP (Fig. 3). The circadian changes	
in GIR could have been produced, therefore, either by	
changes in GRd, HGP, or a combination of both. To differentiate between these possibilities, we measured GTO at 1-h	
intervals between —9:00 A.M. and ~7:00 A.M. the next morning	
in five patients (three of whom had previously participated in	
the 72-h clamp studies).	
Glucose was clamped at 11.6 ± 0.4 mmol/1 (209 ± 7 mg/dl)	
(CV 7.4%). Serum insulin was 168 ± 12 pmol/1 (28 ± 2 |xU/ml)	
and did not change significantly during the 24-h study period.	
GIR exhibited the same circadian changes that were seen	
previously during the 72-h clamp studies, rising from 0 to	
"6.1 ± 1.1 ixmol • kg""1 • min""1 (1.1 ± 0.2 mg • kg""1 • min""1) at"	
—7:00 P.M. and decreasing thereafter to reach a nadir of 1.2 ±	
"0.6 jxmol-kg^-min""1 (0.2 ± 0.1 mg-kg""1 • min""1) -12 h"	
later. HGP closely mirrored the changes in GIR, whereas GRd	
did not change significantly. Plasma FFA and cortisol levels	
paralleled HGP values, although the HGP nadir seemed to	
precede the cortisol nadir by several hours.	
FFA, cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon, lactate, and	
alanine concentrations. Plasma FFA and cortisol concentrations changed with circadian rhythmicity with cycle duraDIABETES, VOL. 45, AUGUST 1996

DISCUSSION
Absence of circadian rhythmicity of insulin secretion in
NIDDM. We have recently reported that insulin secretion
rates and serum insulin levels change with a circadian
rhythm in nondiabetic subjects during hyperglycemic clamping (9). The absence of this rhythmicity is a newly described
defect in patients with NIDDM. Absence of rhythmic insulin

changes allowed us to study insulin sensitivity at constant
blood glucose and insulin levels.
Presence of circadian rhythmicity of insulin sensitivity
in NIDDM. Diurnal rhythmicity of insulin sensitivity and
glucose tolerance in diabetic patients, although long suspected (1-5), has been difficult to demonstrate mainly because of the strong interdependence of changes in glucose
and insulin and other confounding factors including feeding,
exercise, and changes in insulin clearance (1). In the present
study, the patients were kept on bed rest, they did not eat,
and their blood glucose and insulin levels, and insulin
secretion and clearance rates all remained unchanged during
the entire 72-h study. GIR, reflecting total body insulin
sensitivity, rose daily from a nadir in the morning (~8:00
a.m.) to a peak in the evening (—7:00 P.M.). The cycle
duration (from peak to peak) was —24 h hence; these cycles
were by definition circadian. The cycle amplitude (from
trough to peak) was —7.8 ixmol • kg1 • min""1 (1.4 mg • kg""1 •"

min J). To our knowledge, this is the first unequivocal	
demonstration of circadian rhythmicity in insulin sensitivity	
in patients with NIDDM. Similar results have been obtained	
in normal volunteers in whom glucose was infused at constant rates. In these studies, glucose and insulin levels	
changed together, which complicated quantitation of cyclic	
changes in insulin sensitivity (19,20).	
Sleep did not appear to affect the cyclic changes in insulin	
sensitivity because the directional changes (from increase to	
decrease and vice versa) occurred before and after the sleep	
period. Moreover, insulin sensitivity (GIR) was the same	
whether the patients were asleep or awake (4.7 ± 0.9 vs.	
"4.7 ± 0.6 fimol • kg""1 • min""1). Sleep, however, was frequently interrupted; therefore, our data do not rule out the"	
possibility that uninterrupted sleep may have a modulating effect on the circadian rhythmicity of insulin sensitivity as was reported by Van Cauter et al. in normal subjects	
(21).	
What caused the circadian rhythmicity of insulin sensitivity? Changes in GIR could have reflected changes in	
peripheral (muscle) insulin sensitivity (i.e., in GRd), changes	
in hepatic insulin sensitivity (i.e., in HGP), or both. To	
differentiate between these possibilities, we determined GRd	
and HGP in five patients at hourly intervals for 22 h. Glucose	
was again clamped at —11.6 mmol/1, and serum insulin levels	
remained stable. The results indicated unequivocally that the	
nocturnal decrease in GIR was caused by an increase in HGP	
with little or no change in peripheral glucose uptake. These	
results are compatible with a large body of evidence showing	
elevated rates of HGP in patients with NIDDM after an	
overnight fast (22) and with the demonstration that plasma	
glucose levels and HGP rates rise in the early morning hours	
(dawn phenomenon) (8,23). Our data suggested, however,	
that the dawn phenomenon may be explained, at least in	
part, by the circadian HGP cycle, where HGP starts to rise in	
1048	
DIABETES, VOL. 45, AUGUST 1996

the evening, reaches a peak in the early morning hours, and	
then declines. Superimposed on this circadian rhythm may	
be the effects of sleep on HGP, because Clore et al. (24) have	
shown in normal subjects that sleep decreased and arousal	
from sleep increased HGP.	
What caused the circadian HGP changes? Plasma FFA	
concentrations showed circadian fluctuations and correlated	
inversely (r = -0.72, P < 0.001) with GIR (and presumably	
with HGP). Similar close relationships between plasma FFA	
and HGP have recently been demonstrated in normal volunteers (24) and in dogs (25). These studies suggested that	
FFAs stimulated HGP, probably by changing hepatic insulin	
sensitivity. While this concept has been well supported by	
many in vitro studies (26), the in vivo evidence remains	
controversial. Elevation of plasma FFA concentrations has	
been shown to increase HGP only when fatty acid-mediated	
stimulation of insulin secretion was prevented (27). In addition, several studies have shown that acute elevation of	
plasma FFAs resulted in the inhibition of insulin-induced	
suppression of HGP (28,29). It was not clear, however,	
whether this effect was produced by elevated FFA levels or	
by the glycerol that was present in the commercial triglyceride emulsions infused in these studies (29). The present	
study was not complicated by either of these confounders.	
The results thus support the notion that FFAs can produce	
hepatic as well as peripheral insulin resistance (29,30). In	
this respect, it needs to be emphasized that FFAs have been	
shown to inhibit only insulin-stimulated glucose uptake but	
not basal glucose uptake (29). The present study was performed under isoglycemic, i.e., basal conditions; hence, FFA	
did not inhibit glucose uptake.	
Plasma cortisol, which is known to fluctuate in circadian	
cycles, also correlated negatively with GIR (r = -0.64, P <	
0.001). In patients with IDDM, physiological elevations in	
plasma cortisol have been shown to markedly increase HGP	
(31) and, to a lesser degree, to cause peripheral insulin	
resistance (32,33). Recent studies in adrenalectomized rats	
indicated that glucocorticoids played a key role in the fatty	
acid-induced stimulation of gluconeogenesis (34). This and	
data from normal human subjects showing that isolated	
cortisol deficiency reduced plasma FFA concentrations by	
~50% raised the interesting possibility that circadian cortisol	
secretion may have been, at least partly, responsible for the	
circadian FFA rhythmicity (35). Clearly, however, our results	
did not establish a cause and effect relationship between	
FFAs, cortisol, and HGP. In fact, analysis of individual	
relationships showed that in three of the five patients,	
plasma cortisol and HGP changed in synchrony, while in two	
patients cortisol started to rise several hours after HGP.	
These findings do not support the notion that cortisol was	
primarily responsible for the rhythmic changes in HGP,	
because it has been shown that the cortisol effects on HGP	
required several hours to develop (31,33).	
Growth hormone levels increased at the onset of sleep.	
There was, however, no circadian pattern nor did growth	
hormone levels correlate with GIR. Nevertheless, some	
growth hormone bursts may have been missed because of	
the 2-h blood sampling, and the evening growth peaks may	
have contributed to the nocturnal rise in HGP. Plasma	
glucagon concentrations did not change significantly. Epinephrine, which is known to have a circadian rhythm of	
secretion (36), was not measured. The amplitude of the	
circadian epinephrine changes, however, are known to be	
G. BODEN, X. CHEN, AND J.L URBAIN	
too small to affect HGP directly (32,37), but they may be able	
to affect lipolysis and thus plasma FFA concentrations.	
Clinical significance. The circadian rhythmicity of insulin	
sensitivity in patients with NIDDM, described here, predicts	
that glucose tolerance will be worse in the early morning	
than at any other time. This helps to explain why insulin	
requirements in diabetic patients are highest in the morning.	
It also provides a rationale for the effectiveness of the	
twice-a-day regimen, which consists of bedtime insulin and	
daytime sulfonylurea administration, the bedtime insulin	
acting to prevent the nocturnal rise in HGP. Lastly, our data	
suggested that suppression of the nocturnal FFA and/or	
cortisol peaks may offer a new approach to the control of	
fasting blood glucose levels in patients with NIDDM.

Projection of the year 2050 burden of diabetes in	
the US adult population: dynamic modeling of	
incidence, mortality, and prediabetes prevalence	
James P Boyle1, Theodore J Thompson1*, Edward W Gregg1, Lawrence E Barker1, David F Williamson2	
Abstract	
Background: People with diabetes can suffer from diverse complications that seriously erode quality of life.	
Diabetes, costing the United States more than $174 billion per year in 2007, is expected to take an increasingly	
large financial toll in subsequent years. Accurate projections of diabetes burden are essential to policymakers	
planning for future health care needs and costs.	
Methods: Using data on prediabetes and diabetes prevalence in the United States, forecasted incidence, and	
current US Census projections of mortality and migration, the authors constructed a series of dynamic models	
employing systems of difference equations to project the future burden of diabetes among US adults. A threestate model partitions the US population into no diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and diagnosed diabetes. A fourstate model divides the state of “no diabetes” into high-risk (prediabetes) and low-risk (normal glucose) states. A	
five-state model incorporates an intervention designed to prevent or delay diabetes in adults at high risk.	
Results: The authors project that annual diagnosed diabetes incidence (new cases) will increase from about 8	
cases per 1,000 in 2008 to about 15 in 2050. Assuming low incidence and relatively high diabetes mortality, total	
diabetes prevalence (diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) is projected to increase from 14% in 2010 to 21% of the	
US adult population by 2050. However, if recent increases in diabetes incidence continue and diabetes mortality is	
relatively low, prevalence will increase to 33% by 2050. A middle-ground scenario projects a prevalence of 25% to	
28% by 2050. Intervention can reduce, but not eliminate, increases in diabetes prevalence.	
Conclusions: These projected increases are largely attributable to the aging of the US population, increasing	
numbers of members of higher-risk minority groups in the population, and people with diabetes living longer.	
Effective strategies will need to be undertaken to moderate the impact of these factors on national diabetes	
burden. Our analysis suggests that widespread implementation of reasonably effective preventive interventions	
focused on high-risk subgroups of the population can considerably reduce, but not eliminate, future increases in	
diabetes prevalence.	
Background	
People with diabetes often develop diverse microvascular, macrovascular, and neuropathic complications that	
seriously erode quality of life. The high prevalence, high	
incidence, chronicity, and long-term implications for	
health and health care costs make diabetes a major concern for the United States and much of the developed	
and developing world [1,2]. In 2007, diabetes cost the	
US in excess of $174 billion [3]. Diabetes is expected to	
take an increasingly large financial toll in the future,	
particularly on older adults in developed countries and	
on working-age adults in developing countries [4].	
Accurate projections of diabetes burden are essential to	
policymakers planning for future health care needs and	
costs.	
Several future projections of the prevalence, incidence,	
and total number of diabetes cases for the US and other	
countries have been carried out [5-8]. However, previous	
estimates for the US are likely to be outdated because

they relied on 1990 census projections. These older census projections overestimate current mortality rates and	
do not account for the increasing size of the Hispanic	
and foreign-born US populations at higher risk for	
developing diabetes. Previous estimates assumed no	
increase in diabetes incidence and did not consider the	
impact of undiagnosed diabetes on total diabetes prevalence. In addition, earlier estimates ignored the substantial variation in diabetes incidence occurring between	
the subpopulation with normal glucose levels and the	
subpopulation with prediabetes.	
To overcome these limitations and provide contemporary, realistic estimates of the growth of the national	
diabetes burden, we constructed a system of dynamic	
equations that incorporate initial prevalence (percentage	
of population with diabetes, both diagnosed and undiagnosed), incidence (percentage of population with newly	
diagnosed diabetes), migration, mortality, and prevalence	
of prediabetes. These equations model the future burden	
of diabetes on US adults through 2050. We also consider the effect of a hypothetical, large-scale preventive	
intervention.	
Materials and methods	
Data sources	
The data sources for this study include the US Census	
Bureau [9] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [10]. Census data are based on the 2000	
census and include estimates of the 2007 population	
and estimates of mortality rates, net migration, and	
births from 2008 through 2050. CDC data include estimates and standard errors of incidence rates of diagnosed diabetes for the US adult population (aged 18-79	
years) from 1980 through 2007. The application of these	
data depended on a transition matrix that was based on	
a literature review. This matrix contains estimates of the	
rates of transition from having no diabetes, prediabetes,	
and undiagnosed diabetes to having diagnosed diabetes,	
as well as the risk of mortality associated with different	
glycemic and diabetic states.	
Incidence projections	
Let the annual incidence rate of diagnosed diabetes and	
its estimated standard error be denoted by (yt, st) for t =	
1,...,28, corresponding to years 1980 through 2007. We	
fit a logistic growth curve with asymptote r using Bayesian methods [11]. The logistic growth curve restricts	
incidence rates to be monotonic over time. An informative prior distribution, putting approximately 95% of its	
mass between the 2007 US rate ( 0.0078) and the Pima	
Indian rate (0.025) [12] was used for r. The Pima Indian	
incidence rate was used because the Pima have the highest diabetes incidence among subpopulations of the US.	
A normal distribution was assumed for yt Incidence	
projections are denoted as μt for t = 29,...,71, corresponding to years 2008 through 2050. This model is

Diffuse normal prior distributions were used for l0 and	
l1. Four different specifications for εt were considered:	
unstructured, first order autoregressive (AR(1)), first	
order moving average (MA(1)), and first order autoregressive-moving average (ARMA(1,1)). Graphical displays	
of the posterior distributions of the residuals, yt - μt, and	
the residual sum of squares were used to compare models. The AR(1) and ARMA(1,1) were indistinguishable	
and clearly fit better than the unstructured and MA(1)	
models. We used the AR(1) model because it contains	
fewer parameters than the ARMA(1,1) model. The AR(1)	
model’s residuals did not exhibit serial correlation and	
were all less than 0.0005 in absolute value, indicating	
good model fit. Posterior distributions of the projected	
incidences of diagnosed diabetes are simulated as part	
of the model fitting process. Modeling was done using	
WinBUGS software [13].	
Diabetes projections	
We constructed a series of dynamic models that consisted of systems of difference equations in time that are	
similar to models described elsewhere [14,15] to project	
the future burden of diabetes in the United States. These	
models incorporated initial US prevalence, modeled incidence projections, census-based mortality projections,	
and a time-varying transition matrix that differentially	
allotted the population into states of normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, and undiagnosed diabetes/diagnosed	
diabetes. A three-state model partitioned the US adult	
population into the states of no diabetes, undiagnosed	
diabetes, and diagnosed diabetes so that the projected	
total adult population would agree with census projections. A four-state model extended the three-state model	
by splitting the adult population with no diabetes into	
high- and low-risk groups. Finally, we present preliminary results from a five-state model that represents the	
potential effect of a hypothetical preventive intervention	
delivered to all people with impaired fasting glucose	
(IFG), a group at high risk for future development of diabetes. If half of the people with IFG participated in an	
intervention and their incidence was reduced by 50%, it	
would be roughly equivalent to a 25% reduction in all	
people with IFG. Therefore, we assumed that the	
hypothetical intervention would reduce by 25% the	
annual incidence of diabetes in people with IFG.

Key assumptions for the models follow. First, people	
cannot move from diabetes to nondiabetes; this assumption is reasonable because remission is extremely rare.	
Second, the relative risks of death for the two diabetes	
states versus the no diabetes state are constant over	
time. The number of ways that relative risk might vary	
over time is infinite. In the absence of data about which	
of these patterns of varying relative risk to choose, we	
chose the simplest one: no time variation. Third, the	
transition rates to diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes	
for nondiabetics are constant multiples of the transition	
rate to diagnosed diabetes for undiagnosed diabetics.	
This assumption implies the proportion of diagnosed	
diabetics among all new diabetics in any given year is	
constant over time.	
A detailed description of these models, including all	
assumptions, references for key parameter estimates,	
and algebraic derivations, are presented in Appendix 1	
and Appendix 2. The programs for implementing the	
models were written in GAUSS [16].	
Results	
Figure 1 plots the historical incident cases of diagnosed	
diabetes per 1,000 people for 1980 through 2007. It also	
plots three projection scenarios for 2008 through 2050:	
low incidence, which is the 2.5th percentile of the posterior distribution; middle incidence, which is the posterior	
mean; and high incidence, which is the 97.5th percentile	
of the posterior distribution. Historical incidence rates	
range from 3.3 cases per 1,000 in 1980 to 7.8 cases per	
1,000 in 2007. The middle incidence scenario increases	
steadily over the projection horizon, from 8.4 cases per	
1,000 in 2008 to 14.7 cases per 1,000 in 2050. The low	
incidence scenario remains relatively flat, with an average	
incidence of 8.4 cases per 1,000, while the high incidence	
scenario projects extreme increases in incidence from 9.2	
to 22.9 cases per 1,000 for the years 2008 through 2050.	
We denote the relative risk of death for individuals	
with undiagnosed diabetes versus those without diabetes	
as r1 and the relative risk of death for individuals with	
diagnosed diabetes versus those without diabetes as r2.	
Published results [17] lead to estimates r1 = 1.77 and	
r2 = 2.11, and we refer to this set of values as low mortality risk. We also set r1 = 1.00 and r2 = 4.08, consistent with projections from Narayan et al [7] aggregated	
to the US adult population aged 18-79 years, and we	
refer to this set of values as high mortality risk (see	
Appendix 1 for more details).

Table 1 provides projections of the numbers (in millions) of people with no diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes,	
or diagnosed diabetes every fifth year from 2010 through	
2050. We provide projections for the low and middle	
incidence scenarios, both for low mortality risk and high	
mortality risk, for four scenarios. Results for the high	
incidence projections are reported in this section only.	
All four model scenarios indicate at least a doubling,	
and in some cases an even greater increase, in the number of people with diagnosed diabetes from 2010	
through 2050. When compared to this rapid growth, the	
projected number of people with undiagnosed diabetes	
grows slowly under all four scenarios. In Figure 2, the	
prevalence of any diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed)	
increases from 14.1%-14.5% in 2010 to 24.7%, 20.5%,	
32.8%, and 28.3% in 2050 under, respectively, the low	
incidence scenarios (low and high mortality risk) and	
middle incidence scenarios (low and high mortality risk).	
Table 2 (all results in thousands) displays results from	
the hypothetical preventive intervention assessing the	
impact of intervention on diabetes incidence. The fourth	
column displays the number of incident cases of diabetes under the low and middle incidence scenarios	
with low and high mortality risk. The fifth column does	
the same for the number of incident cases and assumes	
that our hypothetical intervention is in place. The sixth	
column displays the difference between the fifth and	
sixth columns, which is the number of incident cases	
the intervention prevented or delayed. For example,	
using the projected middle incidence scenario and low	
mortality risk, 3,490,900 incident cases would be	
reported in 2050 with no intervention and 3,146,100	
incident cases would be reported with intervention, for	
a net reduction of 344,800 incident cases of diabetes.	
Discussion	
Our estimates of diabetes prevalence paint a sobering	
picture of the future growth of diabetes. Under an	
assumption of low incidence and relatively high diabetes	
mortality, total prevalence is projected to increase to	
21% of the US adult population by 2050. On the other	
hand, if recent increases in diabetes incidence continue	
(middle incidence projections) and diabetes mortality	
ratios are relatively low, diabetes prevalence will increase	
to 33% by 2050. The middle-ground (low incidence with	
low mortality or middle incidence with high mortality)	
scenarios project a prevalence of 25% to 28% by 2050.	
In each of the scenarios, the increases are, in part, attributable to demographic changes. The population of the	
United States is aging, and older adults are more likely	
to develop diabetes than younger adults. The size of	
minority populations in the United States also is growing, and some minorities are at greater risk of developing diabetes than non-Hispanic whites. Finally, mortality

among people with diabetes is declining. The result is	
that people with diabetes live longer and contribute to	
prevalence for longer periods of time.	
Two previous diabetes forecasts have linearly extrapolated historical prevalence trends. In 2004, Wild et al	
[18] projected a 114% increase in the number of people	
with diabetes from 2000 through 2030 worldwide. More	
recent estimates on behalf of the International Diabetes	
Federation suggested that, from 2010 through 2030,	
increases in diabetes prevalence will range from a 20%	
increase in Europe to an almost doubling of prevalence	
in Africa and the Middle East [4]. Others have built	
dynamic models incorporating incidence, mortality, and	
migration. A discrete, three-state Markov model that	
stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity projected an	
approximate doubling in US prevalence by 2050 [6,7]. In	
2007, a model using NHANES III as a starting point and	
a midstream validation using NHANES 1999-2002 data	
projected an approximate 50% increase in the next 20	
years in the United States [19]. Magliano et al [20] projected diabetes prevalence in Australia increasing from	
10.1% in 2010 to 17.0% in 2025, a trend similar to our	
low incidence-high mortality risk results.	
Our models, which include the ability to evaluate preventive interventions, suggest that the future prevalence	
of diagnosed diabetes could be significantly worse than	
previously suggested. A large increase in diabetes prevalence could be driven by multiple factors, including	
increasing incidence, better detection, and in-migration.	
Our updated model includes a higher level of incidence	
based on the CDC National Diabetes Surveillance System and projects lower future mortality rates than were	
used in previous models based on US Census data. In	
addition, our model assumes that the mortality rate of	
the diabetic population will decline at least as much as	
that of the nondiabetic population (i.e., the mortality	
rate ratio associated with diabetes will be constant).	
Recent comparison of US cohorts suggests that this	
assumption is reasonable [21].	
The projected loss in quality of life and the projected	
costs of providing health care could be significant.	
Increased efforts in primary prevention of diabetes can	
help to decrease loss in quality of life and the future	
cost of providing care for people with diabetes. Indeed,	
such efforts are essential if we hope to moderate or slow	
the growth of diabetes prevalence. However, as Table 2	
indicates, prevention efforts can be reasonably expected	
to moderate, but not prevent, future growth in the number of people with the disease.	
Our five-state model made the assumption that a	
hypothetical intervention would reach 100% of those with	
IFG and would reduce the annual incidence of diabetes in	
this group by 25%. Future efforts to refine our modeling	
approach will focus on more realistic specification of	
intervention scenarios applied to a variety of population	
subgroups at high risk of developing diabetes. Had we	
split the population at high risk into intervention and nonintervention subsets, we would have obtained estimates	
between the no intervention and intervention cases in	
Table 2. Thus, column six of Table 2 can be viewed as an	
upper bound on the number of incident diabetes cases	
that a hypothetical intervention could prevent.	
Our model is subject to several limitations. Cases of	
diabetes in people younger than age 18 or older than	
age 79 years were not considered. Although diabetes in	
the young is rare, and a relatively small portion of the	
US population is aged 80 years or older, these numbers	
might not be negligible. Our model made many reasonable but untestable assumptions. For example, we	
assumed that the relative risks of death for those with	
detected or undetected diabetes, compared to those	
without diabetes, are constant over time. We assumed	
that the observed increase in diabetes incidence fits a	
logistic growth curve. Given the logistic model, we	
could have chosen either a more or less precise prior	
for r. While assumptions other than the ones we made	
could have been made, we are aware of no data sources	
that would support such assumptions. We assumed that	
census estimates for the intercensal years between 2000	
and 2009 and the census projections of net migration,	
births, and death rates for 2010 and beyond are accurate. We also assumed no feedback effect; for example,	
the increasing prevalence of diabetes could conceivably	
contribute to greater awareness of diabetes, which	
could, in turn, reduce the incidence rate or could result	
in fewer cases of diabetes remaining undiagnosed.	
Finally, our model implicitly assumes that the future will	
resemble the past. Changes in the levels of circulating	
glucose or A1c considered to define diabetes could	
change the prevalence of both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. Major upheavals, such as an epidemic or	
natural disaster that substantially changed birth or death	
rates or a dramatic social change that invalidated census	
projections or caused other changes in the way people	
lead their lives, could have correspondingly major	
impacts on the outcomes of our model.	
We performed a sensitivity analysis that assumed 98%	
prior probability for r, the asymptote of the incidence,	
in the interval (0.0078, 0.025). The sensitivity analysis	
produced no practical difference in the incidence projections. We also investigated the sensitivity of our model	
by considering low mortality risk, high mortality risk,	
middle incidence projections, and low incidence projections. The additional model assumptions are justified in	
the appendices. A formal sensitivity analysis of all	
assumptions would present a substantial technical challenge. We believe it is more useful to policymakers for	
us to present the results of our four model scenarios.

We anticipate that the modeling methods described	
here could be used by other countries, especially those	
with reliable census estimates, to estimate future diabetes burden, as well as the potential effects of interventions to reduce disease burden. Country-specific data	
elements could be easily substituted for the data elements we used to develop a model that fit US population dynamics. Further, a modified form of this model	
might be applicable to other chronic, near-irreversible,	
and sometimes undiagnosed conditions such as heart	
disease.	
Conclusion	
We project that, over the next 40 years, the prevalence	
of total diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed) in the	
United States will increase from its current level of	
about 1 in 10 adults to between 1 in 5 and 1 in 3 adults	
in 2050. The health care costs of a person with diagnosed diabetes are approximately 2.3 times that of a	
person without [3]. Although a formal projection of	
costs is beyond the scope of this analysis, the total societal cost of diabetes is likely to dramatically increase over	
the coming decades. The increases in diabetes prevalence projected here are largely attributable to a combination of three key demographic factors, including aging	
of the US population, increasing size of higher-risk minority populations, and declining mortality among people	
with diabetes. Although these demographic factors	
reflect underlying improvements in the health of the US	
population, effective strategies will need to be undertaken to moderate the impact of these factors on national	
diabetes burden. Our analysis suggests that widespread	
implementation of reasonably effective preventive interventions focused on high-risk subgroups of the population may not eliminate, but might considerably reduce,	
future increases in diabetes prevalence.	
Appendix 1	
Three-state model	
The US adult population is modeled at 1-year intervals	
starting at year t = 28 (2007) and ending at t = 71	
(2050). Specifically, define the following numbers of	
people in various states, rates, and flows. All rates are	
annual and flows occur during year t, i.e., in the interval	
(t-1,t].	
X(t) = the number of adults without diabetes at time	
= t.	
Z(t) = the number of adults with undiagnosed diabetes	
at time = t.	
Y(t) = the number of adults with diagnosed diabetes at	
time = t.	
b(t) = Census projection of the number of adults turning 18 (births) during year t.	
m(t) = Census projection of the number of adults	
migrating into the United States during year t.	
d(t) = Census projected death rate for the US resident	
population aged 18-79 years.	
g(t) = nondiabetes death rate among X(t-1).	
r1g(t) = diabetes death rate among Z(t-1); r2g(t) = diabetes death rate among Y(t-1); r1 and r2 are relative	
risks.	
i(t) = incidence rate of diagnosed diabetes among X(t-1)	
or Z(t-1), denoted earlier by y t	
∧	
.	
I(t)= incidence rate of all diabetes (undiagnosed or	
diagnosed) among X(t-1).	
fx(t) = proportion of b(t) without diabetes.	
fz(t) = proportion of b(t) with undiagnosed diabetes.	
fy(t) = proportion of b(t) with diagnosed diabetes.	
gx(t) = proportion of m(t) without diabetes.	
gz(t) = proportion of m(t) with undiagnosed diabetes.	
gy(t) = proportion of m(t) with diagnosed diabetes.	
The relations fx(t)+ fz(t)+ fy(t) = 1 and gx(t)+ gz(t)+ gy	
(t) = 1 ensure consistency with the census projections.

Note that this matrix displays the distribution of the	
beginning year stocks (rows) to the ending year stocks	
(the columns), and thus, the transition rates in each row	
must be nonnegative and add to unity for each year t.	
Some assumptions about transition rates are apparent.	
First, people cannot move from diabetes to nondiabetes;	
this assumption is reasonable because remission is extremely rare. Second, the relative risks of death for the two	
diabetes states are constant over time. No data were	
found to support time varying relative risks, but published results [17] lead to estimates r1 = 1.77 and r2 =	
2.11. We also set r1 = 1.00 and r2 = 4.08 in a sensitivity	
analysis, consistent with projections from Narayan et al	
[6] aggregated to the US adult population aged 18-79	
years. Third, the transition rates to diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes for nondiabetics are constant multiples of	
the transition rate to diagnosed diabetes for undiagnosed	
diabetics. General time varying rates for these transitions	
were not available, but, as detailed below, estimates of	
Boyle et al. Population Health Metrics 2010, 8:29

ξ1 and ξ2 could be obtained. This assumption implies the	
proportion of diagnosed diabetics among all new diabetics in any given year t is constant over time, i.e.,

. To calculate	
h, assume that 95% of the time a person spends less than	
seven years in the undiagnosed diabetes state [22] and	
that the hazard rate for moving from undiagnosed to	
diagnosed diabetes is constant over time. This equates to	
a 0.19 probability of moving to the diabetes state within	
six months. The transition matrix leads to the system of	
first order difference equations

set of equations simply distributes the net migration for

beginning of the year. All parameters in the model are	
thus determined and the system of equations described	
earlier can be used to calculate the model projections.	
Four-state model	
The four-state model expands the three-state model by	
splitting X(t) = HX(t) + LX(t), where HX(t) = p(t)X(t) is	
the number of adults in a high-risk group (e.g., those	
with IFG) and LX(t) = [1-p(t)] X(t) is the number in a	
low-risk group (e.g., those without IFG). This must be	
done so that X(t), Z(t), and Y(t) are as in the three-state	
model.

The constant c can be calculated as follows. Let l

to any diabetes and p(28) the proportion of the nondiabetic population at high risk in 2007. For example,	
for IFG l = .0287 and p(28) = .257 from Appendix 2.

For the risk strata IFG, this gives c = 6.6. All of this	
ensures that the relevant transition rates from the nondiabetic population to the diabetic population are the same as	
in the three-state model. Since death rates for these populations are as in the three-state model, the four-state

Appendix 2	
There are no published nationally representative estimates for annual incidence of total diabetes (diagnosed	
or undiagnosed) for the US adult nondiabetic population	
or for subgroups defined by glycemic level. The one US	
estimate of diabetes incidence in 2007 for adults aged	
18-79 (0.78%) applies only to diagnosed diabetes [10].	
Therefore, we developed our own estimates of the	
annual incidence of total diabetes for the US nondiabetic adult population.	
Groups defined by glycemic level	
Diabetes incidence in the entire population is a function	
of diabetes incidence in four mutually exclusive glycemic	
subgroups and their prevalence in the nondiabetic population. These subgroups are 1) Normoglycemic (NG):	
fasting blood glucose < 100 mg/dl and 2-hour postchallenge glucose < 140 mg/dl; 2) Isolated Impaired	
Fasting Glucose (IIFG): fasting blood glucose 100-125	
mg/dl with 2-hour post-challenge blood glucose < 140	
mg/dl; 3) Isolated Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IIGT):	
2-hour post-challenge blood glucose 140-199 mg/dl with	
fasting blood glucose < 100 mg/dl; 4) Combined IGT	
and IFG (CIFGT): fasting blood glucose 100-125 mg/dl	
with 2-hour post-challenge blood glucose 140-199 mg/	
dl. We used 2005-2006 NHANES data, after excluding	
people with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes, to	
estimate glycemic group prevalences for the nondiabetic	
US adult population.	
Gerstein et al [24] published estimates of the annualized relative risks of diabetes for IIFG, IIGT, and CIFGT	
with the NG subgroup as referent, but did not report	
the absolute annual incidence for the NG subgroup. To	
calculate the absolute incidence for each glycemic subgroup, the relative risk must be multiplied by the absolute incidence in the NG subgroup.	
Annual incidence in the normoglycemic	
Santaguida et al [25] reported annualized incidence of	
diabetes from 42 studies in which the NG subgroup was	
included. We used 1999-2006 NHANES data to estimate	
that, among US adults aged ≥20 years, the mean age of	
the NG subgroup was 46 years. Four studies included by	
Santaguida et al reported a mean age of 43-48 years.	
One of these studies was on US Pima Indians, who are

believed to have the world’s highest diabetes incidence,	
and this study was excluded. We also identified one	
study published after Santaguida et al that reported a	
mean age of 50 years in the NG subgroup [20].	
The annualized diabetes incidence for the NG subgroup from the four studies was 0.19%, 0.25%, 0.38%,	
and 0.64%. We used the median annual incidence of	
these four studies, 0.32%, to estimate diabetes incidence	
in the NG subgroup in the United States. Engberg et al	
[26] recently reported a nearly identical estimate of	
annual incidence of 0.3% for an NG subgroup from a	
population-based cohort in northern Europe with a	
mean age of 46 years.	
Annual incidence for dysglycemic subgroups	
We multiplied the 0.32% annual diabetes incidence in	
the NG subgroup by the relative risks from Gerstein	
et al [24] of 5.5 (IIGT), 7.5 (IIFG), and 12.1 (CIFGT).	
The result was annual incidences of 1.76% (IIGT), 2.40%	
(IIFG), and 3.87% (CIFGT).	
Annual incidence in the total population	
We multiplied the annual diabetes incidence of each	
independent glycemic subgroup (NG, IIGT, IIFG, and	
CIFGT) by its prevalence in the US nondiabetic population and summed the result, yielding an estimate of	
annual diabetes incidence of 1.06%. This finding is similar to that reported by recent population-based cohort	
studies. Bonora et al [27] studied adults aged 40-79	
years in northeastern Italy and concluded that “...~1% of	
European white individuals aged 40-79 years develop	
Type 2 diabetes annually...” Maskarinec et al [28] studied a multi-ethnic sample of adults aged 45 -74 years	
in Hawaii and estimated an annual diabetes incidence of	
1.04%.

-Cell Deﬁcit and Increased -Cell Apoptosis in	
Humans With Type 2 Diabetes	
Alexandra E. Butler,1 Juliette Janson,2 Susan Bonner-Weir,3 Robert Ritzel,1 Robert A. Rizza,4 and	
Peter C. Butler1	
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by impaired insulin	
secretion. Some but not all studies suggest that a	
decrease in -cell mass contributes to this. We examined pancreatic tissue from 124 autopsies: 91 obese	
cases (BMI >27 kg/m2; 41 with type 2 diabetes, 15 with	
impaired fasting glucose [IFG], and 35 nondiabetic subjects) and 33 lean cases (BMI <25 kg/m2; 16 type 2	
diabetic and 17 nondiabetic subjects). We measured	
relative -cell volume, frequency of -cell apoptosis and	
replication, and new islet formation from exocrine	
ducts (neogenesis). Relative -cell volume was increased in obese versus lean nondiabetic cases (P 	
0.05) through the mechanism of increased neogenesis	
(P < 0.05). Obese humans with IFG and type 2 diabetes	
had a 40% (P < 0.05) and 63% (P < 0.01) deﬁcit and	
lean cases of type 2 diabetes had a 41% deﬁcit (P <	
0.05) in relative -cell volume compared with nondiabetic obese and lean cases, respectively. The frequency	
of -cell replication was very low in all cases and no	
different among groups. Neogenesis, while increased	
with obesity, was comparable in obese type 2 diabetic,	
IFG, or nondiabetic subjects and in lean type 2 diabetic	
or nondiabetic subjects. However, the frequency of	
-cell apoptosis was increased 10-fold in lean and 3-fold	
in obese cases of type 2 diabetes compared with their	
respective nondiabetic control group (P < 0.05). We	
conclude that -cell mass is decreased in type 2 diabetes	
and that the mechanism underlying this is increased	
-cell apoptosis. Since the major defect leading to a	
decrease in -cell mass in type 2 diabetes is increased	
apoptosis, while new islet formation and -cell replication are normal, therapeutic approaches designed to	
arrest apoptosis could be a signiﬁcant new development	
in the management of type 2 diabetes, because this	
approach might actually reverse the disease to a degree	
rather than just palliate glycemia. Diabetes 52:102–110,	
2003	
T	
ype 2 diabetes is characterized by a progressive	
decline in -cell function and chronic insulin	
resistance (1,2). Obesity is a major risk factor for	
the development of type 2 diabetes (3,4) and is	
thought to confer increased risk for type 2 diabetes	
through the mechanism of associated insulin resistance	
(5). However, most people who are obese (and relatively	
insulin resistant) do not develop diabetes but compensate	
by increasing insulin secretion (6). In rodent models of	
obesity without diabetes there is an adaptive increase in	
-cell mass (7). Although not much data are available,	
prior studies suggest that -cell mass is also adaptively	
increased in nondiabetic obese humans (8,9). Regulation	
of the -cell mass appears to involve a balance of -cell	
replication and apoptosis, as well as development of new	
islets from exocrine pancreatic ducts (10,11). Disruption	
of any of these pathways of -cell formation or increased	
rates of -cell death could cause a decrease in -cell mass.	
The islet in type 2 diabetes is characterized by deposits of	
amyloid (12) derived from the peptide islet amyloid	
polypeptide (IAPP), also known as amylin (13). This	
peptide has been shown to cause apoptosis of -cells	
(14,15), particularly when it is in the form of small IAPP	
oligomers (16). However, it is unknown whether -cell	
apoptosis is increased in type 2 diabetes.	
Also, there is controversy whether -cell mass is decreased in type 2 diabetes (9,17–24). These discrepancies	
are in part due to the paucity of available data in humans.	
It is difﬁcult to obtain pancreatic tissue from humans,	
since this usually only becomes available at autopsy, when	
the pancreas may have undergone extensive autolysis.	
Also, reliable clinical information about autopsy cases is	
often unavailable. It is therefore not surprising that there	
are few studies of islet morphology in humans with	
diabetes, and in most of these, only small numbers of	
cases were included. Also, clinical data before death is	
minimal in many of these studies. Given the small number	
of cases, matching the cases for degree of obesity and age	
of death has not always been possible. At the Mayo Clinic	
some of these difﬁculties are overcome. Autopsies are	
performed within 12 h of death (usually 6 h), including	
weekends. The Mayo Clinic integrated medical record	
system allows easy access to the prior clinical records of	
the cases. As the Mayo Clinic tends to be the primary	
health care provider for people hospitalized at the medical

have had a general medical examination (including a	
fasting blood glucose) during the year before death.	
In the present study, we took advantage of the unique	
autopsy material available at the Mayo Clinic to study 124	
human pancreata from cases with and without diabetes	
and matched for obesity. All cases had a well-preserved	
pancreatic specimen and documented general medical	
exam, including a fasting blood glucose obtained during	
the 12 months before death. With this unique resource, we	
sought to address the following questions: 1) In humans	
with obesity, is -cell mass increased compared with lean	
nondiabetic humans? 2) In humans with type 2 diabetes, is	
-cell mass decreased compared with age-, sex-, and	
weight-matched nondiabetic humans? 3) Are there measurable changes in the frequency of -cell apoptosis or	
replication or new islet (ductal) formation among these	
groups in human pancreatic tissue obtained at autopsy	
that might provide insight into the mechanism subserving	
any deﬁcit in -cell mass in type 2 diabetes?	
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS	
Design. We obtained human pancreatic tissue at autopsy from nondiabetic	
subjects, patients with type 2 diabetes, and patients with impaired fasting	
glucose (IFG); pancreatic samples from both obese and lean patients were	
obtained in the nondiabetic and diabetic groups. The current study reﬂects the	
population in Minnesota during the time these patients died, which was 98%	
Caucasian of Northern European origin.	
Subjects. Potential cases were ﬁrst identiﬁed by retrospective analysis of the	
Mayo Clinic autopsy database. To be included, cases were required to have 1)	
had a full autopsy within 12 h of death, 2) had a general medical examination,	
including at least one fasting blood glucose documented within the year	
before death, and 3) pancreatic tissue stored that was of adequate size and	
quality. Cases were excluded if 1) potential secondary causes of type 1 or type	
2 diabetes were present, 2) patients had been exposed to chronic glucocorticoid treatment, or 3) pancreatic tissue had undergone autolysis or showed	
evidence of pancreatitis. Inclusion in the lean subgroup required a BMI 25	
kg/m2, while inclusion in the obese subgroup required a BMI 27 kg/m2. Cases	
were further classiﬁed as nondiabetic (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 110	
mg/dl), IFG (FPG 110–125 mg/dl), or diabetic subjects (FPG 126 mg/dl). As	
a consequence of this process, we ultimately included 124 cases (Table 1).	
Pancreatic tissue processing. At autopsy in all cases, pancreas was	
resected from the tail and, with a sample of spleen, ﬁxed in formaldehyde and	
embedded in parafﬁn for subsequent analysis. The autopsy process does not	
include full dissection and removal of the retroperitoneal pancreas to determine pancreas weight (as is routinely possible in rodent studies with a more	
accessible pancreas). Sections were cut from these parafﬁn blocks and stained	
by Congo Red for hematoxylin/eosin and by immunohistochemistry for	
insulin, as previously described (25). In addition, sections were analyzed for	
replication by immunohistochemistry for Ki67 (anti-Human Ki-67 monoclonal	
antibody MIB-1, 1/25; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) (26) and for apoptosis using the	
TdT-FragEL Kit (cat. no. QIA 33) from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA).	
Analysis of endocrine pancreatic morphology. The hematoxylin/eosin	
slides were examined in all cases to exclude cases with pancreatitis, autolysis,	
etc., as per case selection above. Slides stained for insulin (J.J. and A.E.B.),	
Congo Red, TUNEL, and Ki67 (A.E.B.) were then examined blinded for	
subgroup as detailed below. The blind was broken by P.C.B. and R.R., who	
performed the statistical analysis. S.B.-W. provided guidance with measurement of new islet formation and all aspects of -cell sterology. R.A.R.	
coordinated availability of samples from Mayo Clinic and clinical information	
and overall guidance in study analysis.	
Relative -cell volume to exocrine pancreas. As the pancreas weight was	
not available, it was not possible to calculate the -cell mass. The pancreas	
tends to be slightly larger in nondiabetic than in diabetic humans (27).	
Therefore, the ratio of the -cell area/exocrine area (by convention called the	
relative -cell volume) should provide a conservative estimate of any decline	
in -cell mass in patients with diabetes. To measure this ratio, slides from	
each case were examined using an Olympus IX70 inverted system microscope	
(Olympus America, Melville, NY) connected to a Hewlett Packard computer	
with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, MD). Slides	
immunostained for insulin were analyzed using the Image-Pro Plus system.	
The slide was scanned using 4 objective magniﬁcation. A representative area	
of pancreas section was chosen for analysis and the coordinates entered into	
the program. The image analysis quantiﬁed total tissue area within this region,	
followed by the insulin-positive area to generate the ratio of insulin staining to	
total pancreas area. The sensitivity for the insulin-positive areas was high, so	
that all insulin-positive areas were included irrespective of the intensity of	
staining.	
To ensure that any changes in the relative -cell volume were not due to	
changes in the size of individual -cells (for example due to degranulation),	
we also measured the density of nuclei per insulin-positive area in the obese	
and lean type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic groups. Five islets from each case	
stained for insulin were imaged to provide the insulin-positive area (m2) and	
digitally photographed at high power (40). The resulting images were	
examined by A.E.B. to manually count the number of nuclei present within the	
insulin-stained area in order to compute the ratio of nuclei per insulin-positive	
area (m2).	
Quantiﬁcation of islet size and islet relative -cell volume. To establish	
islet size and the islet relative -cell volume, 20 islets larger than four cells	
were studied in detail from each case. First, a ﬁeld at objective magniﬁcation	
20 was chosen at random, and then the islets in this ﬁeld and those in the	
immediately adjacent ﬁelds were examined until 20 islets had been evaluated.	
Each of these 20 islets was evaluated to obtain the total islet cross-sectional	
area and the area within this islet positive for insulin. For each case, a mean

cross-sectional islet area, a mean cross-sectional insulin area within the islet,	
and a mean percentage area positive for insulin within the islet were therefore	
determined to provide the islet relative -cell volume.	
Quantiﬁcation of exocrine duct cells positive for insulin for islet	
neogenesis estimate. To assess the relative rate of islet neogenesis from	
exocrine duct cells, we quantiﬁed the percentage of exocrine duct cells that	
were immunoreactive for insulin. A mean (SE) of 281  11 duct cells were	
evaluated as positive or negative for insulin from each pancreas. The resulting	
data were expressed as the percentage of duct cells positive for insulin in each	
pancreas, and the mean was calculated for each group.	
Apoptosis and replication. Slides stained by the TUNEL and Ki67 techniques were each evaluated in direct comparison with those immunostained	
for insulin in each case. In most cases, samples of spleen were ﬁxed and	
parafﬁn embedded with the pancreas, providing positive controls for apoptosis and replication in the splenic follicles. The number of positive cells that	
corresponded to an insulin-positive area in the adjacent section were counted	
per islet. An average of 75 islets were examined per case, and the mean	
number of positive cells per islet calculated for each case. TUNEL staining	
was occasionally present in debris that was no longer present in a distinct cell;	
these were not counted. Only discernible cells with TUNEL-positive nuclei	
were included. As the relative -cell volume differed among groups (see	
RESULTS), we also computed the frequency of -cell apoptosis and -cell	
replication events divided by the relative -cell volume to provide a comparison of these events relative to -cell volume per case.	
Islet amyloid. To quantify islet amyloid, slides from each case were stained	
by Congo Red and examined under polarized light for birefringence. Cases	
were scored for 1) presence or absence, 2) frequency of islet amyloid (using	
a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 indicated that no islets showed apple green	
birefringence, 1 indicated that a few islets in the sample were birefringent, 2	
indicated that numerous islets in the sample were birefringent, and 3 indicated	
that most islets were birefringent), and 3) extent of islet amyloid (again using	
a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 indicated that no islets were birefringent, 1	
indicated minimal extent and weak intensity of birefringence in affected islets,	
2 indicated moderate extent and intensity of birefringence in affected islets,	
and 3 indicated marked extent and intensity of birefringence within affected	
islets).	
Statistics. The speciﬁc hypotheses posed were tested by use of a Student’s t	
test. When all ﬁve groups of cases were compared, ANOVA was used. A P	
value 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Linear correlation was	
performed by regression analysis with a best-ﬁt line and 95% CIs shown	
graphically.	
RESULTS	
Cases (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 1). BMI and age of death	
did not differ among the type 2 diabetic, nondiabetic, or	
IFG subgroups within the obese group. Similarly, there	
was no difference in age of death or BMI between lean type	
2 diabetic and nondiabetic patients. As expected, the	
obese cases had a higher BMI than the lean cases. Also,	
lean cases died at a greater age than obese cases (P 	
0.0001). The treatments used by patients with type 2	
diabetes were diet, sulfonylurea pills, or insulin. No other	
classes of oral medications for glycemic control were	
available at the time these patients were living. In Table 2,	
we show the number of cases treated by each of these	
medication types before death.	
Relative -cell area to exocrine pancreas (Table 3	
and Fig. 2). We report that obesity in nondiabetic humans	
is characterized by an 50% increase in relative -cell	
volume (2.6  0.39 vs. 1.71  0.28%, P  0.05, obese	
nondiabetic vs. lean nondiabetic subjects). Since the nondiabetic obese humans died younger than the nondiabetic	
lean humans, the comparison in the relative -cell volume	
between these groups may have been confounded by this	
age difference. Obese humans with IFG (1.56  0.25%) and	
type 2 diabetes (0.96 	 0.1%) had a 40% (P  0.05) and 63%
(P  0.01) deﬁcit in relative -cell volume compared with	
nondiabetic obese subjects. The decreased -cell volume	
in patients with type 2 diabetes was due to a decreased	
number of -cells rather than a decreased volume of	
individual cells, since the ratio of nuclei per m2 of	
insulin-positive area was no different between the nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic groups (obese 6  1  10

3 nuclei/m2, lean 5  1  10	
3 vs. 7  1 

3 nuclei/m2; P  NS). Compared with obese nondiabetic cases, obese patients with type 2 diabetes had a	
decreased relative -cell volume (Fig. 3) irrespective of	
whether they were treated by diet alone (0.78  0.13, 70%	
decreased; P  0.01) or on oral medications (0.86  0.25,	
67% decreased; P  0.05) or insulin (1.3  0.2, 50%	
decreased; P  0.05). There was no difference in the mean	
FPG values among these three treatment groups during	
the last 2 years of life (Fig. 3). Lean subjects with type 2	
diabetes had 41% deﬁcit in relative -cell volume (1.0  0.2	
vs. 1.7  0.3%, P  0.05) compared with lean nondiabetic	
subjects. The lean diabetic subjects showed a decrease in

subjects [TTDM]) and lean cases (nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic

relative -cell volume irrespective of whether they were	
treated with diet only (1.24  0.34, P  NS), oral medications (0.86  0.2, P  0.05), or insulin (0.82  0.17, P 	
0.05 using Welch’s correction) (Fig. 4). These ﬁndings	
were consistent with the observations in individual islets	
examined from each group. The mean islet size was	
similar in all groups studied (Table 3). In contrast, the	
relative -cell islet volume was decreased in obese cases	
with type 2 diabetes compared with nondiabetic obese	
cases (P  0.05) and in lean cases with type 2 diabetes	
compared with nondiabetic lean cases (P  0.01).	
Quantiﬁcation of exocrine duct cells positive for	
insulin (Figs. 5 and Fig. 6). The presence of islets	
budding from exocrine ducts were present in all pancreata	
irrespective of obesity or diabetic status. To quantify this	
process, we quantiﬁed duct cells immunoreactive for	
insulin. There was an increased percentage of -cell–	
positive duct cells in obese versus lean cases (P  0.05),	
but no difference between the obese nondiabetic and type	
2 diabetic cases (P  0.60) or lean type 2 diabetic and	
nondiabetic cases (P  0.83).	
Replication and cell death (Fig. 7 and Table 3). To	
further attempt to elucidate the mechanism for the deﬁcit	
in -cell mass present in type 2 diabetes, we examined the	
frequency of -cell apoptosis and replication. The frequency of replication was very low in all cases examined.	
There was no signiﬁcant difference in the frequency of	
replication between obese nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic	
subjects or lean nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects	
(Fig. 7). There was a trend for decreased -cell replication	
and new islet formation with aging (Fig. 8). Although there	
was a suggestion of an increased frequency of apoptotic	
events per islet (Table 3) in obese type 2 diabetic versus	
nondiabetic cases, this did not reach signiﬁcance. However there was an increased frequency of apoptotic events	
per islet in lean type 2 diabetic versus nondiabetic cases	
(P  0.05). Since the relative -cell volume was decreased	
in type 2 diabetes, we also examined the frequency of	
-cell apoptosis per islet divided by the relative -cell	
volume so that a comparison could be made of the	
frequency of -cell apoptosis normalized to -cell mass.	
When the frequency of apoptotic events was expressed as	
the frequency of -cell apoptosis divided by the relative	
-cell volume, then the frequency of apoptosis was 3fold increased in obese cases of type 2 diabetes (P  0.05)	
and 10-fold increased in lean cases of type 2 diabetes	
(P  0.05) versus their respective control groups.	
Islet amyloid (Fig. 9). As expected, islet amyloid was	
present in the majority of obese cases with type 2 diabetes	
when compared with obese nondiabetic cases (81 vs. 10%,	
P  0.01). Of interest, islet amyloid was not increased in	
obese cases of IFG compared with obese nondiabetic	
cases. In the lean cases, islet amyloid was present in 88%	
of type 2 diabetic subjects versus 13% of nondiabetic

subjects (P  0.01). The frequency with which islets in a	
given sample showed positive birefringence, and the extent of birefringence in affected islets was higher in type 2	
diabetic cases, both lean and obese, when compared with	
their nondiabetic counterparts.	
DISCUSSION	
We report that the relative -cell volume in humans with	
both IFG and type 2 diabetes is decreased.	
A limitation of the present studies is use of the relative	
-cell volume as a surrogate of -cell mass. This approach	
will be in error to the extent that there were differences in	
the overall mean pancreatic weight among groups. However, available data suggest that the pancreatic weight is	
similar (21,22) or decreased in patients with diabetes	
(9,27). If pancreatic weight is decreased in type 2 diabetes,	
then use of the insulin-positive area as a percentage of	
total exocrine area should introduce, if anything, a conservative error and underestimate any decrease in -cell	
mass in type 2 diabetes. Earlier reports that the -cell mass	
is decreased in type 2 diabetes may have included cases of	
type 1 diabetes (17,18). However, more recent reports in	
which clinical information was better characterized conclude that -cell mass is decreased in type 2 diabetes	
(9,22,24), whereas others report no decrease in -cell mass	
(19,21). Another study presented in the proceedings of a	
recent meeting (23) reported a decreased -cell mass in	
lean or obese patients with type 2 diabetes who required	
insulin. However, in contrast to our ﬁndings, they reported	
that obese type 2 diabetic cases treated by diet only or oral	
medications did not have a decreased -cell mass. The	
reason for the discrepancy with the latter study is not	
known, although it is clear that type 2 diabetes is a	
heterogeneous disease with a polygenic basis and that	
there may well be differences in the islet in this disease	
depending on the region from which the population was	
sampled. A question that arises from the present study is:	
what is the signiﬁcance of an 60% decrease in -cell mass	
in humans? Although rodents tolerate a partial pancreatectomy in which up to 80% of the -cell mass is removed	
(28), primates (29) and pigs (30) develop diabetes with a	
decrease of -cell mass of 50% or greater. Furthermore,	
humans who have had 50% of their pancreas removed	
have abnormal glucose tolerance (some developing diabetes by more recent classiﬁcation) and diminished insulin	
secretion in response to a hyperglycemic clamp (31–33).	
Taken together, these ﬁndings imply that the 60% deﬁcit	
in -cell mass observed in the present study, particularly	
in the context of insulin resistance encountered in type 2	
diabetes, is sufﬁcient to play an important role in causing	
hyperglycemia. In the current study, we report that the	
group with IFG, a group at high risk of developing type 2	
diabetes, had a 40% deﬁcit in relative -cell volume compared with comparably obese control subjects with normal fasting glucose concentrations. This observation	
implies that the deﬁcit in the -cell volume (and presumptive mass) is an early process in the development of type	
2 diabetes and is likely of primary importance rather than	
simply secondary to hyperglycemia.	
-Cell mass in rodents is dynamic and regulated with	
input of -cells from new islet formation and -cell replication within islets and output from -cell senescence	
(apoptosis) (10,11). Our data support this concept and	
extend it to humans. Also, we support prior data reporting	
that obese nondiabetic humans increase -cell mass, presumably in response to insulin resistance (8,9). However,	
the extent of this increase (50%) in the markedly obese	
humans studied here is much lower than the increase	
observed in obese mice (5- to 10-fold) (34). The reported	
increase here may, however, be an underestimate, since	
the pancreatic weight in obese nondiabetic humans tends	
to be larger than lean nondiabetic humans (9). Again, this	
would introduce a conservative error in the stated conclusion that -cell mass is increased in obese nondiabetic	
versus lean nondiabetic humans. We report that the mechanism of this increased -cell mass in humans appears to	
be through increased new islet formation, assuming that	
the percentage of insulin-positive cells in exocrine ducts is	
related to this process. However, in contrast to rodents, it	
has been reported that there is almost no -cell replication	
within existing islets in humans (35), as conﬁrmed in the	
present work, and therefore (not surprisingly) this does	
not appear to be an important mechanism for regulation of	
-cell mass in humans. The relatively less importance of	
this pathway for regulation of -cell mass in humans	
compared with rodents is consistent with the observation	
that obese mice develop very large islets (34,36), whereas	
in humans, islet size is minimally altered by obesity (Table	
3). The frequency of apoptosis was not different in the	
FIG. 4. The mean FPG concentration (A) and the relative -cell volume	
(B) in the lean group of nondiabetic (ND) subjects or diabetic patients	
who were treated with insulin, sulfonylurea pills (Oral), or diet only.

obese nondiabetic versus lean nondiabetic humans (Table	
3). In conclusion, -cell mass is regulated in humans, with	
the rate of new islet formation apparently the predominant	
pathway for increased -cell mass in response to obesity.	
To elucidate the underlying mechanism of the relative	
loss of -cell mass in type 2 diabetes, we also examined	
the frequency of new islet formation as well as -cell	
replication and apoptosis in islets from each group. Rodent studies have shown that increased rates of -cell	
replication can contribute to compensatory increases in	
-cell mass, for example in response to partial pancreatectomy (28) or short-term glucose infusions (37,38). We did	
not observe a decreased frequency of -cell replication in	
islets of type 2 diabetic versus nondiabetic cases, although	
it might be argued that in the presence of hyperglycemia,	
there should have been an increased frequency of replication if human islets respond in the same manner as rodent	
islets. The capacity for increased rates of -cell replication	
is diminished in the Otsuka-Long-Evans-Tokushima fatty	
rat model of diabetes (39). It has also been reported that	
genetic background inﬂuences the capacity for increased	
rates of -cell replication in other animal studies (40).	
However, given the extremely low frequency of -cell	
replication present in human islets compared with rodent	
islets, it appears that this important mechanism for regulation of -cell mass in rodents is unimportant in humans.	
There is increasing interest in the process of new islet	
formation from exocrine ducts as a mechanism to replenish or increase -cell mass (10,11,41,42). We observed new	
islet formation from exocrine ducts and scattered single	
-cells in all cases in the present study consistent with	
recent (42) and some much older studies in humans (43).	
There was no difference in the percentage of exocrine duct	
cells positive for insulin in type 2 diabetic versus nondiabetic subjects, in either the lean or obese groups. This	
implies that the mechanism that enhances new islet formation in response to obesity is intact in humans with type	
2 diabetes. In animal models, both an acute decrease in	
-cell mass (partial pancreatectomy [41]) and hyperglycemia (38) induce an increase in new islet formation. As	
patients with type 2 diabetes had both a decreased -cell	
mass and hyperglycemia, it could be argued that there is a

type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms that induce an	
increased rate of new islet formation in response to a	
partial decrease in -cell mass and hyperglycemia in	
rodents are not known, nor is it known whether such	
adaptive changes occur in humans. Also, it is unknown	
whether these adaptive increased rates of new islet formation are sustained over years (as in humans with	
diabetes) as opposed to weeks (as in rodent studies of	
hyperglycemia). One very positive implication from the	
present studies is that the rate of new islet formation is	
sustained in patients with longstanding diabetes. In fact,	
there was no difference in the rate of new islet formation	
versus age in patients with or without type 2 diabetes.	
These data imply that if the increased rate of apoptosis	
present in type 2 diabetes (vida infra) could be inhibited, it	
should be possible to restore -cell mass in these patients.	
Since new islet formation, the predominant input into	
the -cell mass in humans, appears to be intact in type 2	
diabetes, one might predict that the mechanism for the	
decreased -cell mass in type 2 diabetes is an increase in	
-cell apoptosis. Consistent with this, we report a 3-fold	
increased frequency of -cell apoptosis in obese cases of	
type 2 diabetes and a 10-fold increased frequency in lean	
cases of type 2 diabetes compared with the nondiabetic	
control cases. The increased frequency of apoptotic events	
per islet in type 2 diabetes is relatively low (0.3 cells per	
cross section), raising the question: is this sufﬁcient to	
account for the decreased -cell mass in type 2 diabetes?	
The difﬁculty presented by both the frequency measurements of apoptosis by the TUNEL technique as well as the	
replication by Ki67 is that they do not easily translate into	
rates. From time-lapse video microscopy studies using	
-cell lines (R.R., P.C.B., unpublished observations), we	
have observed that apoptosis takes 120 min from initiation to completion (disintegration of the cell). The nuclear	
debris might still stain positively by the TUNEL method	
after this period, but in the present studies, we only included TUNEL-positive events when the staining was	
present in an identiﬁable cell (see RESEARCH DESIGN AND	
METHODS) and did not include the staining of debris that	
was occasionally present. If we make the crude assumption that the 60% loss of -cell mass observed in type 2	
diabetes in the current study takes 5 years to evolve, the	
net loss of -cells per islet per day would be 0.8 cells per	
islet per day (assuming 3,000 -cells/islet). Given the fact	
that each islet cross section only observes a portion of a	
given islet, the frequency of an excess of 0.3 apoptotic	
cells per islet seen here is potentially sufﬁcient to account	
for the degree of -cell loss.	
If the cause of the decreased -cell mass in type 2	
diabetes is increased -cell apoptosis, what is the mechanism of this? One of the features present in islets of most	
humans	
with	
type	
2	
diabetes	
is	
amyloid	
deposits	
(22,25,44–48) derived from IAPP, also known as amylin	
(13). The role of islet amyloid in the pathogenesis of type	
2 diabetes remains controversial. Several lines of evidence	
support a potential role of IAPP in the pathophysiology of	
-cell loss in type 2 diabetes. First, spontaneous type 2

-CELL DEFICIT IN TYPE 2 DIABETES

diabetes occurs in humans, monkeys, and cats, all of	
which share close homology in IAPP sequence and have	
IAPP that spontaneously forms amyloid ﬁbrils in an aqueous environment (45–48). Species such as rats and mice	
that have an IAPP sequence that does not form ﬁbrils in an	
aqueous solution (49) do not spontaneously develop type 2	
diabetes, but instead require selective genetic manipulation (e.g., leptin-deﬁcient mice) to develop diabetes (50).	
Furthermore, it has been shown that IAPP oligomers	
cause -cell apoptosis (14,15), possibly by causing nonselective ion-channel leaks in cell membranes (16). Although	
it is not plausible to collect pancreatic tissue prospectively	
from humans, transgenic mice (for human IAPP) are now	
available which, when obese, spontaneously develop diabetes characterized by islet amyloid and decreased -cell	
mass (51). Prospective studies in these mice support the	
hypothesis that the mechanism of the decreased -cell	
mass is increased apoptosis (34).	
One argument that has been made against the pathogenic importance of both islet amyloid in type 2 diabetes	
and cerebral amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease is that not all	
affected cases have amyloid present. In the current study,	
10% of type 2 diabetes had no islet amyloid present in the	
examined sample. Furthermore, only a minority (10%) of	
the cases with IFG had islet amyloid present, while they	
already had a deﬁcit in presumptive -cell mass of 40%.	
These data are consistent with the previously stated	
hypothesis that small IAPP oligomers (not detectable by	
light microscopy) are the cause of -cell loss, whereas the	
large extracellular amyloid deposits visible by light microscopy are inert (16,25). Alternatively, it is possible that	
the formation of islet amyloid is secondary to hyperglycemia and not of primary importance in the pathophysiology	
of type 2 diabetes.	
Another factor that might contribute to the increased	
rate of apoptosis observed in type 2 diabetes might be	
hyperglycemia. Recently, it has been shown that islets	
exposed to high glucose concentrations have an increased	
rate of apoptosis (52). This mechanism could certainly	
compound the effects of IAPP oligomers once hyperglycemia supervenes. Since hyperglycemia and insulin resistance increase the expression rate of IAPP to a greater	
extent than insulin (53,54), hyperglycemia might also	
further enhance apoptosis due to IAPP oligomers.	
In summary, we report that relative -cell volume, and	
therefore the presumptive -cell mass, is decreased in	
both obese and lean humans with type 2 diabetes compared with their nondiabetic age- and weight-matched	
counterparts. In the current study, this decrease is present	
whether the cases were treated by insulin, sulfonylureas,	
or diet. Furthermore, humans with IFG have a decreased	
relative -cell volume, suggesting that this is an early	
process and mechanistically important in the development	
of type 2 diabetes. Finally, we ascribe the mechanism for	
the decrease in -cell mass to an increase in the frequency	
of -cell apoptosis with the rate of new islet formation	
being unaffected. The implication for prevention of type 2	
diabetes is that strategies that avoid the increased frequency of -cell apoptosis are most rational. Also, in	
people with established type 2 diabetes, inhibition of this	
3- to 10-fold increased rate of apoptosis may lead to	
restoration of -cell mass since islet neogenesis appears	
intact. To realize these goals, further studies to appreciate	
the mechanism of increased -cell apoptosis are warranted.

Adverse Metabolic Consequences in Humans	
of Prolonged Sleep Restriction Combined	
with Circadian Disruption

Epidemiological studies link short sleep duration and circadian disruption with higher risk of metabolic syndrome	
and diabetes. We tested the hypotheses that prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, as	
can occur in people performing shift work, impairs glucose regulation and metabolism. Healthy adults spent	
>5 weeks under controlled laboratory conditions in which they experienced an initial baseline segment of optimal	
sleep, 3 weeks of sleep restriction (5.6 hours of sleep per 24 hours) combined with circadian disruption (recurring	
28-hour “days”), followed by 9 days of recovery sleep with circadian re-entrainment. Exposure to prolonged sleep	
restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, with measurements taken at the same circadian phase, decreased	
the participants’ resting metabolic rate and increased plasma glucose concentrations after a meal, an effect resulting	
from inadequate pancreatic insulin secretion. These parameters normalized during the 9 days of recovery sleep and	
stable circadian re-entrainment. Thus, in humans, prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption	
alters metabolism and could increase the risk of obesity and diabetes.	
INTRODUCTION	
Short sleep duration and disordered sleep have been linked to numerous adverse metabolic changes (such as dysregulation of multiple hormone axes, reduced insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, and glucose	
intolerance) (1–4), increased risk of chronic disease including obesity	
and type 2 diabetes (5, 6), and early mortality (7, 8). Less is known	
about the adverse consequences of misalignment between endogenous	
circadian physiological rhythms and the daily environmental and behavioral rhythms, as occurs chronically in night workers and rotating	
shift workers (9–12). Endogenous circadian rhythms are controlled by	
the central circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the	
hypothalamus, and these rhythms help to synchronize molecular circadian clocks in peripheral cells and tissues. Peripheral clocks optimize	
physiological functions to match daily patterns of behavior, such as	
feeding, activity, and sleep. Suboptimal alignments between endogenous circadian rhythms and daily behaviors occur in the many millions	
of people who perform shift work, and this circadian disruption may	
contribute to the known adverse health consequences of shift work,	
including fatigue and poor sleep, gastrointestinal complaints, detrimental metabolic changes, and increased risks of developing obesity	
and diabetes (13–19). For example, over a 3-year follow-up period, the	
risk of progressing from impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose	
tolerance to clinically classified diabetes was five times higher among	
night shift workers than among those who did not work at night (20).	
In humans, acute (a few days) misalignment of the normal circadian phases at which sleep and meals occur causes higher postprandial	
blood glucose, despite higher insulin concentrations in the blood. The	
magnitude of hyperglycemia was comparable to a prediabetic state in a	
third of these individuals (21). In mice, a laboratory study of prolonged	
(10 weeks) circadian disruption revealed broad adverse changes in the	
brain (dendritic reorganization and loss), behavior (learning and response	
to novel environments), and glucose metabolism (increased insulin at	
the same blood glucose concentrations, and weight gain) (22). It is not	
known whether these adverse effects of sustained circadian disruption	
also occur in humans, but if they do, they could explain the epidemiological finding of an increased incidence of diabetes in shift workers.	
Both sleep patterns and circadian rhythms change profoundly with	
age. Older people experience less sleep, more frequent awakenings, a	
reduction of slow wave sleep (23), and blunting of the amplitudes of circadian rhythms such as core body temperature (CBT) (24) and activity	
(25). Also, the phase relationships between those rhythms and the	
timing of sleep change with age (26). Given the possible adverse metabolic changes caused by short sleep and circadian disruption, it is also	
plausible that the sleep and circadian changes with age could contribute to the increased incidence of obesity and diabetes in the elderly (1).	
Because of these findings, we have here tested the hypotheses that	
prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption impairs glucose regulation and metabolism in humans and that this effect	
would be more pronounced in older individuals. We have previously	
used a forced desynchrony protocol in humans to assess the separate	
effects of sleep and of circadian rhythms upon cognitive performance	
(12, 22, 27–29). This protocol was also recently used in mice (22). In	
this protocol, behaviors, including the wake-sleep cycle and the feedingfasting schedule, are scheduled to occur on “days” that are much shorter	
or much longer than 24 hours (for example, 28 hours), and during	
wakefulness, lights are kept dim so that the endogenous circadian pacemaker oscillates at its intrinsic period rather than being reset by daily	
exposure to the light-dark cycle (12, 28, 29). We selected an imposed	
28-hour duration of environmental and behavioral cycles for the current study because it is well outside the range of entrainment of the	
circadian pacemaker, forcing desynchronization between endogenous	
circadian rhythms and the scheduled dark-light, fasting-feeding, and

sleep-wake cycles. We combined this model of circadian disruption with	
sleep restriction of 5.6 hours per 24 hours for ~3 weeks to test our hypotheses that prolonged sleep restriction combined with prolonged circadian	
disruption would impair glucose regulation and metabolism and that	
such effects would be more pronounced in older people.	
RESULTS	
Participant characteristics	
Twenty-four participants completed the full protocol (12 young plus	
12 older participants). Three participants were excluded from group	
analyses (see Materials and Methods), leaving 11 young (mean, 23 ±	
2 years; 5 female) and 10 older (60 ± 5 years; 5 female) participants	
in the analyses.	
Measurement segments	
To ensure that participants were not suffering from sleep loss before	
starting the study and had stable circadian phase alignment, they were	
instructed to spend 10 hours in bed each night, with a self-selected but	
constant bedtime and normal exposure to daytime light, for at least	
3 consecutive weeks immediately before entry into the laboratory.	
Thereafter, each participant lived in an individual laboratory suite	
for 39 days in dim light and without time cues. Figure 1 schematically	
portrays the protocol and highlights the three intensive assessment intervals during which body weight, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and	
metabolic responses to a standardized meal were measured: (i) a baseline “sleep-replete” condition with stable circadian phase alignment	
(after at least 27 days of 10 to 16 hours of sleep opportunity per 24 hours,	
including at least 21 days at home and 6 days in the laboratory); (ii)	
after up to 3 weeks of exposure to sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption induced by imposition of 28-hour fasting-feeding,	
and sleep-wake cycles, performed in dim light; and (iii) after 9 days of	
circadian re-entrainment and recovery sleep opportunity of 10 hours	
per 24 hours. These three intensive assessment intervals were timed to	
occur when sleep episodes were at the normal optimal circadian phase	
for each participant and standardized meals were at similar circadian	
phases (see Materials and Methods).	
Effects of sleep restriction and circadian disruption on	
postprandial hyperglycemia and RMR	
After a standard breakfast eaten at a consistent circadian phase, previous exposure to prolonged (3 weeks) sleep restriction with concurrent	
circadian disruption significantly increased both fasting and postprandial peak plasma glucose concentrations relative to the responses	
to the same meal at baseline [Figs. 2, A, B, E, and F, and 3, A, C, and E;	
overall changes: fasted, +8%, P = 0.0019 (signed-rank test); postprandial peak, +14%, P = 0.0004 (t test); integrated postprandial response over 90 min, +15%, P < 0.0001 (t test)]. There were no	
statistical differences between age groups in the effects of prolonged	
sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption on fasting or	
postprandial glucose concentrations. The relative hyperglycemia after	
this breakfast meal was apparently caused by inadequate glucosetriggered pancreatic b cell insulin secretion, because fasting plasma insulin	
and postprandial peak and integrated plasma insulin concentrations were	
significantly reduced [Figs. 2, C, D, G, and H, and 3, B, D, and F; overall	
changes: fasted, −12%, P = 0.0064 (signed-rank test); postprandial peak,	
−27%, P < 0.0001 (t test); integrated postprandial response over 90 min,	
Fig. 1. Study schedule. Participants completed a 39-day laboratory protocol with a baseline sleep-replete condition with 3 weeks of 10 hours/day	
of time in bed at home, then 6 days with ≥10 hours time in bed per day.	
Sleep opportunities (dark bars) were then spread across the circadian	
cycle on a 28-hour forced desynchrony protocol, with 6.5 hours time in	
bed (equivalent to 5.6 hours per 24 hours) and 21.5 hours of monitored	
wakefulness for 3 weeks. A subsequent interval of 10 days of circadian	
re-entrainment with sleep recovery (10 hours time in bed/24 hours) with	
the sleep interval adjusted to the same circadian phase as the baseline	
sleep condition by modification of the duration of the wake interval after	
the last day of forced desynchrony. B, samples taken for standardized

sleep restriction plus circadian disruption such that the standardized	
meal occurred during this exposure at the same circadian phase as baseline within 4 hours (0.7 ± 1.8 hours), resulting in an average exposure	
duration of 19.2 ± 2.8 24-hour days (range, 15 to 22 days).

was lower at recovery (this results in a significant interaction between	
age and condition for the peak postprandial glucose; P = 0.012; Fig. 3C).	
Glucose responses expressed as 2-hour postprandial levels (for comparison to the clinical threshold of 140 mg/dl, which indicates impaired glucose tolerance and prediabetes) revealed that 3 of 21 participants had	
prediabetic postprandial glucose concentrations after prolonged exposure to sleep restriction with circadian disruption, whereas no participants had abnormal responses during baseline or recovery/realignment	
(see profiles, Fig. 2).	
Previous exposure to the combination of 3 weeks of sleep restriction plus circadian disruption significantly reduced RMR relative to	
baseline (−8% on average for all participants). RMR returned toward	
baseline levels in the recovery phase but did not completely recover	
(Fig. 3H). There were no statistical differences between the age groups	
in the relative magnitude of the reduction in RMR.

in the models that we derived (see Materials and Methods) to quantify the	
fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin responses to a standardized	
meal [baseline, peak, area under the curve (AUC) (trapezoidal method),	
and 90-min profiles]. The effects of sleep restriction and circadian disruption on glucose (peak, fasted, AUC) were independent of sex.	
Effect of sleep and circadian disruption on rhythms of	
glucose, insulin, and cortisol	
To determine whether there were changes in blood hormones over the	
course of the exposure to sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, we took fasted samples from each participant upon awakening on each experimental “day” during the first and third weeks of the	
recurring 28-hour cycles (first and third “beat cycles” of the forced	
desynchrony as shown in Fig. 1). When grouped across each week, the	
sampling times encompassed the full range of circadian phases. There	
were significant endogenous circadian rhythms in glucose, insulin, and	
cortisol (Fig. 4) (all P < 0.01), with similar amplitudes and timing between the first and the third week of exposure. For each analyte, peaks	
occurred about 60 circadian degrees relative to the nadir of the CBT	
rhythm (which was assigned a value of 0°), which corresponds to the	
usual morning when under normally entrained conditions. For comparison, fasted (prebreakfast) values were collected in the baseline condition at an average circadian phase of 73 ± 27°, which equates to 4.9 hours	
after the CBT minimum. Mean fasted cortisol and mean fasted glucose	
were similar from week 1 to week 3 (that is, no progressive changes).	
However, fasting insulin levels remained close to baseline during the	
first week of exposure, then declined below baseline by the third week	
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 4). There were no significant differences in any of these	
circadian rhythms by age group or sex (P > 0.05).	
Twenty-four–hour profiles of leptin and free ghrelin	
Compared to baseline, 24-hour profiles of ghrelin concentrations (Fig. 5,	
A to D) were slightly higher during sleep restriction and recovery (both	
P < 0.05), whereas the 24-hour profiles of leptin (Fig. 5, E to H) were	
slightly lower during sleep restriction (P = 0.05) and recovery (P < 0.05).	
In the 24-hour profiles of plasma leptin (Fig. 5, E to H), we observed no	
significant difference between the age groups across conditions or interactions between age group and condition. There was, however, a significant interaction between age group and time (P = 0.04), reflecting	
the higher leptin levels across the scheduled sleep period in young compared to older participants. For 24-hour profiles of free ghrelin (Fig. 5,	
A to D), there were no significant differences between age groups	
across conditions, and there were significant interactions between age	
group and condition (P = 0.02), and between age group and time	
(P < 0.0001), reflecting higher across the scheduled sleep periods free	
ghrelin levels in young compared to older participants.

Body weight, diet, activity, and body temperature during	
exposure to sleep restriction with circadian disruption	
Young participants were significantly heavier than older participants	
at baseline (72.3 ± 12.0 kg versus 67.9 ± 11.8 kg; P = 0.04), whereas	
there was no significant difference in body mass index (24.2 ± 2.6 kg/m2	
versus 23.3 ± 1.9 kg/m2). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans at baseline revealed that the average whole-body fat was not significantly different between age groups [17.2 ± 7.3 kg (24.5 ± 8.5% of body weight)	
in young; 20.6 ± 2.8 kg (31.3 ± 5.6% of body	
weight) in older participants; P = 0.11].	
Average trunk fat was slightly lower in the	
young participants [7.9 ± 3.7 kg (23.0 ±	
8.7% of trunk mass) versus 10.4 ± 2.0 kg	
(31.2 ± 5.2% of trunk mass); P = 0.05] in	
the older participants. Both groups lost	
mass during the study as assessed by fasted,	
post-void weights measured at scheduled	
wake time on the day before each of the	
three standardized metabolic assessments	
(condition: P < 0.0001; age × condition: P =	
not significant). On average, they lost 1.2 ±	
1.3% body mass by the end of sleep restriction with circadian disruption segment	
(P = 0.0003), and had lost 1.7 ± 1.7% by	
the end of the recovery condition compared	
to baseline (P = 0.0003). In a multiple linear	
regression model, changes in body weight	
were unrelated to changes in RMR, consumed calories (total kilocalorie increased	
by an average of only 6 kcal/24 hours from	
baseline to sleep restriction), or actigraphically assessed physical activity (which increased by 58 ± 37% from baseline to	
sleep restriction, presumably due to the	
increased duration of wakefulness). Thus,	
the increase in activity without an increase	
in food intake would be the most likely	
cause of the small reduction in body weight.	
In multiple linear regression models comparing baseline to either sleep restriction	
with circadian disruption or recovery, weight	
changes were not associated with changes	
in 24-hour mean leptin levels (percent	
fat-adjusted), body temperature, activity	
levels, food consumed, or metabolic rate.	
Average CBT actually decreased slightly	
(0.09 F° ± 0.37 SD) and was positively	
correlated with weight decline from baseline to sleep restriction with circadian misalignment {weight difference (in pounds) =	
−0.91 + 2.03× [core temperature difference	
(in F°)]; P = 0.043, r2 = 0.30}, suggesting	
that, on average, 0.1° decrease of core temperature corresponds to 0.2 pounds of decrease in body weight. Effects of combined	
circadian and sleep disruption on changes	
in glucose AUC and insulin AUC were unrelated to changes in body weight (Pearson	
correlation r = 0.28, P = 0.22 and r = 0.35,	
P = 0.12, respectively). In multiple regression analyses, changes in postprandial insulin and glucose were unrelated to energetics

DISCUSSION	
Our findings reveal a potential mechanism that may account for	
results from animal studies and human epidemiological findings, suggesting that sleep restriction and circadian disruption are associated	
with impaired metabolism and increased risk of obesity and diabetes.	
We found that simultaneous exposure to chronic sleep restriction and	
circadian rhythm disruption causes a 32% decrease in insulin secretion	
in response to a standardized meal. This substantially impaired response led to inadequate glucose regulation: glucose levels were higher	
for a longer time and even rose to prediabetic levels in some participants. The inadequate insulin secretion by the b cell may underlie the	
elevated risk of diabetes in people subject to chronic exposure to sleep	
deficiency and recurrent circadian disruption.	
In addition, our data are consistent with recent epidemiological	
results demonstrating that life-style factors, including habitually short	
sleep duration, increase the risk of weight gain over the life course (30).	
The 8% drop in RMR that we measured in our participants who experienced sleep restriction and circadian disruption translates into an	
~12.5-pound increase in weight over a single year (120 kcal/day ×	
365 days/3500 kcal/pound of fat mass), assuming no changes in activity	
or food intake. This weight gain may in turn elevate diabetes risk.	
In 1999, Spiegel et al. described alterations of multiple hormonal	
axes and glucose intolerance in humans when sleep was restricted to	
4 hours per night for 1 week, leading the authors to hypothesize “…that	
chronic sleep loss could increase the severity of age-related pathologies, such as diabetes…” (1). Generally, impaired glucose metabolism	
is caused in one of two ways: (i) changes in insulin secretion in which	
pancreatic b cells do not secrete enough insulin in response to a glucose stimulus, or (ii) altered insulin sensitivity in which peripheral tissues	
fail to respond to an insulin signal by increasing their glucose uptake, the	
usual response to a meal. In recent experiments, when sleep is restricted	
to 5 hours per night for a week, young adult men show reductions in	
insulin sensitivity (measured with both euglycemic hyperinsulinemic	
clamps and intravenous glucose tolerance tests), with no change in the	
acute insulin response and without a change in RMR (3). These findings	
are consistent with those from middle-aged adults restricted to 5.5 hours	
of sleep per night for 2 weeks, who exhibited decreases in insulin sensitivity (31). Thus, we are beginning to understand the extent to which	
sleep deficiency impairs glucose metabolism, but need more information	
about the extent, mechanisms, and dynamics of these changes. The magnitude (hours of sleep per night) and duration of sleep restriction (days	
to weeks) are likely to be important in determining the speed and extent	
of diabetogenic changes.	
Another recent study demonstrated that acute circadian misalignment (sleeping during the biological day and eating during the biological night), as occurs with jet lag and shift work, results in similar	
adverse effects on glucose metabolism: increased postprandial glucose	
despite increased circulating insulin levels, suggesting reduced insulin	
sensitivity, coupled with an inability of the pancreas to sufficiently increase insulin secretion (21). Circadian misalignment usually also involves some degree of sleep restriction (sleep efficiency declined by	
17% when misaligned in that study), representing a combined physiological challenge. The protocol in the present study was a more prolonged and severe challenge, combining sleep and concurrent circadian	
disruption for an average of 19 days. Sleep restriction alone in younger	
men and middle-aged adults leads to no change in RMR (3, 32). However, our prolonged sleep restriction and circadian disruption protocol	
caused a notable decrease in RMR, along with significantly elevated glucose in response to a meal.	
Quite unexpectedly, and unlike previous results from short-term	
acute sleep interventions, we also found a decreased insulin response	
to a standardized meal, suggesting that there was pancreatic dysfunction unrelated to the small loss of body weight. Previous sleep restriction	
studies have shown reduced insulin sensitivity (3, 31) but no change in	
the insulin response to a meal (1). Although a decreased insulin response to a more metabolically challenging glucose tolerance test has	
been reported in one sleep restriction study (1), two more recent studies	
have not observed this change (3, 31). In contrast, acute circadian misalignment results in a higher postprandial insulin response that is nonetheless inadequate (21). Our findings demonstrate that, with long-term	
(chronic) exposure to sleep restriction and circadian disruption, the	
pancreas exhibits more severe dysfunction, as shown by our observation	
that insulin levels actually decreased despite elevated plasma glucose	
levels. This physiological mechanism could explain the association	
of habitual sleep deficiency and elevated risk for obesity and diabetes	
(5, 6) and for weight gain and diabetes in a longitudinal study of male	
night workers (33, 34). In our study, the effects in these healthy individuals were largely reversible with 9 days of stable circadian re-entrainment	
and recovery sleep.	
All of the metabolic assessments that we made during baseline and	
after exposure to chronic sleep restriction and circadian disruption	
were done at the same transiently realigned phase of the central circadian pacemaker. Controlling for the central circadian pacemaker phase	
of the metabolic assessment ensured that the effects observed were due	
to the combination of the previous histories of prolonged sleep restriction and of circadian disruption, rather than acute misalignment. Further research will be necessary to understand the development of	
metabolic dysregulation via desynchronization of the central circadian	
pacemaker with respect to peripheral tissue oscillators and sleep-wake,	
fasting-feeding, and dark-light cycles (35).	
Peripheral clocks are entrained by food intake in rodents (36). Although no data are available from human studies, it is possible that the	
effects we observed are a result of a reduced temporal coordination	
between central circadian pacemaker and peripheral tissues (37) such	
as the pancreas that may be responding to changes in meal timing independent of central circadian clocks (38). Misalignment of the phase	
of peripheral oscillators (for example, in the pancreas and liver) with	
that of the central circadian pacemaker may thus also play a role in metabolic dysregulation. If the central circadian pacemaker and peripheral	
pacemakers are out of phase, then the normally coordinated response	
to a meal may be dysfunctional and lead to abnormal physiological	
responses to food intake. Peripheral metabolism-related oscillators	
coordinate both metabolic and circadian pathways (39) required for	
normal hepatic lipid metabolism and homeostasis (40). These findings	
and others (35), together with our current results, suggest that synchronized central and peripheral circadian processes may also be necessary	
for the optimal regulation of energy homeostasis in mammals.	
Previous studies of sleep restriction in healthy young men have shown	
a decrease in plasma leptin and an increase in total ghrelin coupled	
with increased hunger and appetite (41, 42), possibly reflecting relative	
underfeeding in those studies. A study of young women exposed to a

single night of partial sleep restriction revealed an elevation of fasted	
morning leptin levels (43). Epidemiological studies of short sleep duration have shown that shorter self-reported habitual sleep duration	
is associated with lower leptin levels and higher total ghrelin levels	
(44, 45). In contrast, another laboratory study in middle-aged men and	
women exposed to either 8.5 or 5.5 hours per night of time in bed for	
2 weeks but with ad libitum food observed no differences in leptin or	
ghrelin. Instead, calorie consumption in the form of snacking increased,	
such that the participants consumed more than 200 kcal more food per	
day in the sleep-restricted condition (32). This increased food intake	
may have thereby normalized the leptin- and ghrelin-related hunger	
signal associated with sleep restriction. Although we observed no change	
in fasted morning leptin levels in either young or older participants exposed to prolonged sleep restriction, circadian disruption, and controlled	
caloric intake at the end of this segment and through recovery, 24-hour	
leptin was slightly lower and 24-hour free ghrelin was slightly higher.	
This result may indicate that the combination of sleep restriction plus	
circadian disruption may be a qualitatively different challenge than either sleep restriction or circadian disruption alone, or that the prolonged duration of our stimulus (averaging 19 days) may have been	
responsible for the leptin and free ghrelin results.	
Glucose and cortisol concentrations were higher during the first week of	
the combineddisruptions (relative to baseline), andthese levelspersisted	
atallcircadianphasesthroughthethirdweekofexposure.Incontrast,fasting	
insulin levels were the same as baseline for the first week, yet were lower	
through the third week of exposure and were not accompanied by further	
alterations in glucose. The different alterations in these hormones suggest	
that multiple adaptive or maladaptive processes may be at play in this	
longer-term combined exposure study. The changes in fasted insulin from	
the first to the third weeks of exposure are presumably related to impaired	
insulin responses to meals during the prolonged exposure segment.	
We observed some age-related differences at baseline (for example,	
adiposity, RMR, fasted leptin, and body weight), but generally, the	
effects of the exposure were age-independent: Both young and older	
participants responded to prolonged sleep restriction combined with	
circadian disruption with higher glucose levels and lower insulin responses to a standard meal eaten at a consistent circadian phase. We	
did observe a differential recovery response by age for RMR and postprandial peak glucose. This general lack of age effect was contrary to our	
expectations. We note that we studied healthy nonobese participants to	
ensure that comorbidities did not influence results. Thus, our older	
participants were very likely to be more healthy than the general older	
population at large, in whom responses may be different.	
Our study has limitations. Although we did see differences between	
the first and the third week of the challenge, to determine the actual	
mechanisms underlying these effects, future studies will need to have	
more frequent assessments for weeks to months of exposure, and use	
challenges such as meal responses, intravenous glucose tolerance tests,	
and glucose clamp studies. We did not assess changes by, or control	
for, the phase of the menstrual cycle in female participants, but there	
were no notable differences by sex or between age groups, possibly suggesting no difference between responses in these younger premenopausal and older postmenopausal women. The weight loss observed	
during the sleep restriction and circadian disruption segment may have	
been a result of the participants’ relatively underfed state. However, the	
average observed weight loss was quite minor (1.2% of body weight during the exposure segment). Moreover, in correlation analyses, the degree	
of weight loss in individual participants was not significantly related to	
their metabolic changes, and the weight loss persisted during the recovery phase when metabolic responses had returned to baseline. Thus, the	
reduction in insulin levels with sleep restriction and circadian disruption in the current study likely occurred via mechanisms unrelated to	
changes in body mass or any underfeeding.	
Our results suggest that efforts to reduce the health impact and risk	
of diabetes in shift workers should focus on improving sleep duration	
and circadian realignment strategies to minimize circadian disruption	
and desynchrony of central and peripheral circadian oscillators.	
MATERIALS AND METHODS	
Study design	
All participants were studied in the Intensive Physiological Monitoring	
Unit of the Center for Clinical Investigation at Brigham and Women’s	
Hospital (Boston, MA) and provided written informed consent. All procedures were approved by the Partners Human Research Committee	
and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.	
Participant recruitment and screening	
Healthyadultparticipantswererecruitedusingnewspaperadvertisements,	
flyers, and Web site postings. To ensure stable circadian rhythms, participants had no history of regular night shift work for the 3 years before	
the study and no history of travel across more than two time zones in the	
3 months before the study. Licensed physicians and clinical psychologists	
performed physical examinations and psychological screenings. Participants underwent an all-night clinical polysomnogram to rule out sleepdisordered breathing and other sleep disorders. Participants were free of	
any disorders of sleep, circadian rhythms, and metabolism and passed a	
urine toxicology screen during screening and upon admission to the	
inpatient study. Participants received payment for volunteering in this	
study, equivalent to ~$10 per hour when in the laboratory.	
Prestudy conditions	
Participants were instructed to maintain a consistent sleep-wake schedule for at least 21 days (mean, 29.3 ± 12.3 days; range, 21 to 69 days)	
before admission with a 10-hour per night scheduled time in bed, at a	
self-selected, regular time, and compliance with these instructions was	
confirmed by wrist actigraphy for at least 3 weeks before admission	
(Actiwatch-L, Mini Mitter). A sleep diary and calls to a time-stamped	
phone answering system assured compliance.	
Inpatient study conditions	
Participants were admitted to the Intensive Physiological Monitoring	
Unit of the Center for Clinical Investigation at Brigham and Women’s	
Hospital for the 39-day inpatient stay (Fig. 1) in a controlled laboratory	
environment free of time cues, maintained at a temperature of 75 ±	
3°F. The first 3 days each included a 12-hour nighttime sleep opportunity; days 2 to 4 had a nap near the middle of the normal waking time	
to achieve sleep satiation. Days 4 to 6 included a 10-hour nighttime	
sleep opportunity (referred to as baseline). This was followed by the	
forced desynchrony portion of the protocol, consisting of eighteen,	
28-hour sleep-wake cycles with a 21.47-hour wake episode and a 6.53-hour	
sleep opportunity (equivalent to 5.6 hours of sleep opportunity per	
24 hours) over 3 weeks. For recovery, participants were realigned to	
their baseline circadian phase for light-dark, meal, and sleep-wake	
cycles, then spent 10 inpatient days each at an entrained circadian

phase with a 10-hour nighttime sleep opportunity before being discharged. During wakefulness, participants were allowed to perform activities such as writing, reading, board or card games, movie viewing, arts	
and crafts, listening to or playing music, and mild stretching (exercise was	
prohibited). Research technicians observed participants throughout the	
study, either by closed-circuit television or by direct observation during	
waking episodes throughout the laboratory protocol. Light levels were	
maintained at <0.02 lux during sleep opportunities and at <15 lux during	
wake episodes to avoid circadian phase–resetting effects of light.	
Timing of metabolic assessments and	
recovery sleep episodes	
During the three stages of the experiment, we made metabolic assessments of at least 24 hours at similar circadian phases (±4 hours), as	
determined by CBT collected at 1-min intervals with a rectal thermistor (Measurement Specialties). Circadian period and phase of CBT were	
analyzed with nonorthogonal spectral analysis (NOSA), as previously	
described (28). NOSA analysis was also used to determine the initial	
endogenous CBT minimum. Even though all participants were exposed	
to the same 21-day challenge, we wanted to ensure that standardized	
metabolic measurements were made in the different conditions at closely	
matched central circadian pacemaker phases for each participant. Further, there were slight differences in the intrinsic circadian period among	
participants. For these reasons, the measurement period during the challenge segment occurred on slightly different protocol days among the	
participants. The average period of the internal circadian pacemaker	
was 24.13 ± 0.22 hours (range, 23.46 to 24.50 hours; P = not significant	
for age), the average duration of challenge at the time of the metabolic	
assessments was 19.2 ± 2.8 24-hour days (range, 15 to 22 days), and the	
average difference in circadian phase relative to baseline at the times of	
these measurements was +0.7 ± 1.8 hours.	
Forced desynchrony (circadian disruption)	
metabolic assessments	
Upon waking each day during weeks 1 and 3 of the sleep restriction	
combined with circadian disruption segment, fasted blood samples	
were drawn through an indwelling intravenous catheter for assessment of glucose, insulin, cortisol, leptin, and free ghrelin. By design,	
these samples were collected across a range of circadian phases to quantify the acute and chronic effects of both circadian misalignment and	
circadian disruption with the scheduled light-dark, feeding-fasting,	
and sleep-wake schedule.	
Controlled diet	
During the inpatient portion of the study, participants received an isocaloric, controlled nutrient diet consisting of 55 to 60% carbohydrate,	
15 to 20% protein, 15 to 30% fat, 150 meq Na+ (±20%), 100 meq K+	
(±20%), and a minimum of 2.5 liters of fluid per 24 hours. The initial	
diet was designed based on the Harris-Benedict equation with an activity factor of 1.4 (46). Each participant was given identical breakfast	
meals during the three intensive 24-hour sampling intervals at baseline, at the end of the forced desynchrony, and after 9 days of stable	
circadian re-entrainment and recovery sleep. Participants were required	
to finish all food. A eucaloric diet was maintained by increasing or	
decreasing kilocalories when changes in wake-time, fasted, post-void	
weights exceeded 1 kg. Weighed foods confirmed that actual consumed	
diet changed from baseline by a mean of only 6 kcal/24 hours during	
the forced desynchrony segment.	
Resting metabolic rate	
A validated and Food and Drug Administration–approved indirect calorimeter (Medgem 100, HealtheTech Inc.) was used to estimate RMR in	
kilocalories per day from expired gases (47). Measurements were made	
after wake time for 12 to 15 min before standardized breakfasts.	
Blood sampling	
Fasting blood samples were taken on multiple days throughout the inpatient stay. During the three intensive 24-hour sampling intervals,	
blood sampleswere taken every 10 min for an hour after breakfast, every	
30 min during the following 2 hours, and hourly at all other times.	
Assays	
Glucose was assayed with Gluco-quant Glucose/HK kits (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) with a sensitivity of 2 mg/dl, an inter-assay precision	
CV (coefficient of variation) of 1.7%, and an intra-assay precision CV	
of 1.0%. Insulin and cortisol were assayed with kits from Beckman	
Coulter Inc. The insulin assay had a sensitivity of 0.03 mIU/ml, an interassay precision of 3.1 to 5.6%, and an intra-assay precision of 2.0 to	
4.2%. The cortisol assay had a sensitivity of 0.4 mg/dl, an inter-assay precision of 6.4 to 7.9%, and an intra-assay precision of 4.4 to 6.7%. Leptin	
and active ghrelin were measured with ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits (Millipore Corp.). The leptin assay had a sensitivity	
of 0.5 ng/ml for the standard assay (25-ml sample size) and 0.125 ng/ml	
for the sensitive assay and an inter-assay precision of 2.6 to 6.2% for the	
standard assay and 1.3 to 8.6% for the sensitive assay and an intra-assay	
precision of 2.6 to 4.6% for the standard assay and 1.4 to 4.9% for the	
sensitive assay. The sensitive assay was used to repeat samples with	
results below the threshold of the standard assay. The ghrelin assay	
had a sensitivity of 8 pg/ml, an inter-assay precision of 3.5 to 6.6%,	
and an intra-assay precision of 1.6 to 3.6%.	
Study participants	
Of the 24 participants to complete the study protocol, 21 were included	
in these analyses: 11 young (5 female; mean, 23 ± 2 years) and 10 older	
(5 female; 60 ± 5 years). One participant was excluded from these	
analyses because blood samples were not obtained during intensive	
sampling intervals due to intravenous sampling difficulties. One young	
and one older participant were excluded from these analyses because	
their circadian temperature phase on the evaluation day after exposure	
to circadian disruption and sleep restriction was >4 hours different	
from that at baseline.	
Statistical methods	
Data are presented as means ± SD unless otherwise indicated. Linear	
or generalized mixed-effects models were applied to study the effects	
of the history of sleep restriction combined with circadian disruption	
on metabolic measures. Participants were treated as random effects.	
For studying the postprandial responses (baseline, peak, AUC by the	
trapezoidal method, and 90-min profiles), condition (baseline, exposure, recovery), age group, sex, and percent body fat were treated as	
fixed effects and were entered into the initial model, but only significant variables are reported in the final models. Because age was a main	
interest, age and the interaction of age and condition were retained in	
all models. For studying the effect of exposure to the combination of	
circadian disruption and sleep restriction on fasted sample measures	
during the exposure, we used identical models, adding a term for number of weeks into the exposure (beat cycle). Linear regression models

Recent evidence has emerged that peroxisome	
proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), which is	
largely involved in lipid metabolism, can play an	
important role in connecting circadian biology and	
metabolism. In the present study, we investigated	
the mechanisms by which PPAR influences the	
pacemakers acting in the central clock located in	
the suprachiasmatic nucleus and in the peripheral	
oscillator of the liver. We demonstrate that PPAR	
plays a specific role in the peripheral circadian	
control because it is required to maintain the circadian rhythm of the master clock gene brain and	
muscle Arnt-like protein 1 (bmal1) in vivo. This regulation occurs via a direct binding of PPAR on a	
potential PPAR response element located in the	
bmal1 promoter. Reversely, BMAL1 is an upstream	
regulator of PPAR gene expression. We further	
demonstrate that fenofibrate induces circadian	
rhythm of clock gene expression in cell culture	
and up-regulates hepatic bmal1 in vivo. Together,	
these results provide evidence for an additional	
regulatory feedback loop involving BMAL1 and	
PPAR in peripheral clocks. (Molecular Endocrinology 20: 1715–1727, 2006)

IRCADIAN RHYTHMS ENABLE numerous organisms to adapt to daily environmental changes	
such as light, temperature, and social communication	
and serve to synchronize multiple molecular, biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes.	
Circadian rhythms persist with an approximate 24-h	
periodicity even in temporally isolated subjects, indicating the presence of an autonomous time-keeping	
system called circadian clock. In mammals, circadian	
rhythms are generated by the main pacemaker located	
in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus (1). To ensure that internal time coincides with	
environmental time, the clock must be adjusted, a	
process known as entrainment. In mammals, light received by the eyes synchronizes the oscillator through	
the retino-hypothalamic tract and hence synchronizes	
the behavior of the organism with the daily 24-h lightdark (LD) cycle (for review, see Refs. 2–6).	
In addition to the SCN, other peripheral tissues such	
as liver, heart, kidney (7, 8), as well as isolated cells (9)	
express clock genes giving rise to circadian rhythms	
with a different phase from that observed in the SCN.	
Interestingly, these peripheral clocks can be resetted	
by alternative routes independently of the SCN, for	
example by forced change of feeding time (10, 11).	
Several lines of evidence suggest that the peripheral	
circadian clocks are not SCN independent but require	
inputs from the SCN to drive the rhythmicity and ensure an ordered response of the organism to environmental changes (12, 13). Thus, the SCN is believed to	
coordinate rhythms in the brain and body via a combination of neural and humoral diffusible and synaptic	
signals (7, 14, 15).	
Genetic analyses have identified master clock genes	
such as clock, bmal1, period (per1, 2), and cryptochrome genes (cry1, 2), as well as the orphan nuclear	
receptor genes, rev-erb and ror (16, 17). Other transcription factors functioning in the circadian regulation	
of gene expression, including DBP-related factors

(18), Rev-erb, ROR and - (19) have also been identified. The clock mechanism mainly involves an integrated network of interacting self-sustained transcriptional-translational	
feedback	
loops,	
composed	
of	
positive and negative regulators, which drive their own	
rhythmic expression and the one of clock-controlled	
genes to perform a fine tuning of circadian gene expression (20).	
Recent reports have highlighted the interplay between circadian oscillators, metabolism, and physiology. Whereas genes involved in the glucose and lipid	
metabolism are known to exhibit circadian variations	
(21–23), molecular studies have revealed a critical role	
for bmal1 and clock genes in regulating glucose homeostasis (24) and lipid metabolism (25–28). Moreover, the cross talk between ROR and Rev-erb was	
shown to be physiologically important for the control	
of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism (29–31). In	
turn, the peripheral clocks can be coordinately regulated by multiple circulating factors, which are affected	
by the metabolic status of the organism. Indeed, glucose, one of the major food metabolites that exhibits a	
plasma diurnal rhythm, is a direct resetting signal in	
cultured cells by down-regulating per1 and per2 RNA	
levels (32). The levels of glucose-regulated hormones	
such as insulin or glucagon immediately up-regulate	
per1 and per2 expression (13). In addition, other studies have revealed an important role of glucocorticoids	
and retinoids in the resetting of peripheral clocks (33,	
34). Although the elucidation of the mechanisms that	
govern the connection between metabolism and circadian clock has just begun, it appears that several	
members of the nuclear receptor family are involved in	
this pathway.	
Evidence has emerged that peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor  (PPAR), a member of the nuclear	
receptor superfamily that regulates the expression of	
numerous genes involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, can play a role in the normal circadian regulation. First, PPAR has been identified as a	
circadian clock-controlled gene with a diurnal rhythm	
at the mRNA and protein levels in rats and mice in	
many peripheral organs such as liver, heart, kidney,	
and to a lesser extent in the SCN, where the central	
pacemaker is located (7, 35, 36). This circadian expression of PPAR may be in part controlled by hormonal factors, because insulin and glucocorticoids	
regulate its mRNA expression (35, 37–39). A recent	
study has also shown that the circadian expression of	
PPAR mRNA is regulated by the peripheral oscillators in a CLOCK-dependent manner (27). Second, because daily variations in lipogenic and cholesterogenic	
gene expression are attenuated or abolished in mice in	
which the PPAR gene has been disrupted, PPAR	
may be an important mediator for the circadian regulation of lipid metabolism (40, 41). It is now believed	
that PPAR has a wider general role in transducing	
hormone messages involved in dietary status (42).	
These observations thus suggest that PPAR may be	
required in the control of circadian food-dependent	
fluctuations in gene expression. Third, PPAR is connected to the regulation of other nuclear hormone	
receptors such as Rev-erb, because fenofibrate, a	
PPAR agonist, induces human and rat rev-erb expression in liver through the direct binding of PPAR	
on an atypical DR2 element located in the rev-erb	
promoter (30, 43). It was recently shown that CLOCK	
plays an important role in lipid homeostasis by regulating the circadian transactivation of potential PPAR	
response element (PPRE)-controlled target genes (26)	
and of PPAR gene itself via an E-box rich region in	
vivo and in vitro (27). Fourth, the partner of PPAR,	
RXR, interacts with CLOCK protein in a ligand-dependent manner and inhibits CLOCK/brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1 (BMAL1)-dependent activation	
via an E-box element (34). Other results have also	
suggested that PPAR deficiency disturbs the normal	
circadian regulation of certain SREBP-sensitive genes	
in the liver (40, 44).	
Despite much evidence supporting a role of PPAR	
in metabolic control and energy homeostasis (45) and	
the accumulation of data connecting metabolism and	
circadian biology (3, 46, 47), little is known concerning	
the influence of PPAR on the circadian clock. In the	
present study, we investigated the mechanisms by	
which PPAR can influence the pacemakers acting in	
the SCN and in the liver. We report that PPAR-deficient (PPAR/) mice present similar locomotor activity with wild-type (WT) mice without any molecular	
alteration of clock gene expression in the SCN. Interestingly, we show for the first time that PPAR is a	
direct regulator of bmal1 expression in liver via its	
direct binding on a PPRE located on the bmal1 promoter. This regulation is required to maintain the normal circadian oscillation of bmal1 in vivo. Stressing the	
importance of the regulatory pathway that exists between PPAR and the peripheral clock genes, we	
show that fenofibrate up-regulates bmal1 gene expression in murine liver and induces circadian rhythm	
of clock gene expression in cell culture in a PPARdependent manner. Reversely, we also observe that	
BMAL1 is an upstream regulator of the PPAR gene	
expression. Taken together, our data implicate PPAR	
in a new regulatory loop that controls peripheral circadian clocks.

To evaluate the influence of PPAR on the function of	
the central circadian oscillator, behavioral analysis of	
the circadian rhythm was carried out using PPAR/	
and WT littermate mice. Animals were first synchronized for 2 wk to a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle (12L:	
12D). Under these light conditions, WT and PPAR/

motor activity to the dark period of the LD cycle (Fig.	
1A). No difference in the total amount of daily activity	
was observed between WT and PPAR/ mice (Fig.

with endogenous period similar between both genotypes (24.11  0.11 and 24.12  0.08 h, respectively,	
in PPAR-deficient and WT mice).	
To determine whether the inactivation of PPAR can	
alter the master oscillator in the SCN at the molecular	
level, we further compared the circadian expression	
profiles of clock genes in the SCN of WT and PPAR	
mutant mice (Fig. 1C). There is no significant difference in the amplitude and in the phase of the circadian	
expression of the tested clock genes (bmal1, per2,	
per3, cry2, and rev-erb). This clearly suggests that

there is no major molecular effect of the PPAR deletion at the central clock level and that the expression	
of PPAR in the SCN is not essential for the basal	
maintenance of the central circadian timing system.	
PPAR Is Required to Maintain the Amplitude of	
the Circadian Expression of bmal1 in the	
Murine Liver	
To evaluate the role of PPAR on the circadian system	
of the liver (a peripheral clock), where it is mainly	
expressed, we analyzed the circadian expression of	
several clock genes in liver isolated from WT and	
PPAR mutant mice. As already reported, PPAR expression effectively follows a circadian rhythm in peripheral tissues such as liver, kidney, and muscle (data	
not shown). Figure 2 shows that all the clock genes	
tested (bmal1, per1, per2, per3, cry2, and rev-erb) are	
expressed in a circadian manner with no modification	
in the phase of their rhythm between both genotypes.	
By contrast, the amplitudes of bmal1 and per3 expression are drastically affected in PPAR-deficient mice	
by comparison with the WT, with a significant decrease at circadian time 1 (CT1) and CT21 for bmal1	
(where CT0 is subjective day beginning at 0700 h, and	
CT12 is subjective night beginning at 1900 h) and an	
increase at CT8 for per3. These data suggest that	
PPAR does not influence the phase synchronization	
properties of the liver clock but affects the amplitude	
of two major clock genes bmal1 and per3.	
Food-Induced Phase Resetting Entrains	
Circadian PPAR Expression and Is Globally	
Maintained in Liver of PPAR/ Mice	
Although the day-night cycle is the most obvious time	
cue, animals can also respond to other synchronizing	
signals, and feeding time appears to be a potent temporal cue, or Zeitgeber, for the liver clock (10, 11).	
According to PPAR role in the hepatic lipid metabolism during starvation, we hypothesized its potential	
role in food phase resetting of the liver clock. To examine whether the daily feeding time can affect the	
phase of the PPAR circadian expression in the liver,	
WT mice were fed for 2 wk exclusively during the day	
or during the night. As expected, mice fed exclusively	
during the day displayed an inversed phase in circadian hepatic expression of bmal1, per1, per3, and	
rev-erb gene by comparison to mice fed only during	
the night. Similarly, feeding during the day entirely	
inversed the phase of liver PPAR expression (Fig.	
3A), a result that is in agreement with the demonstration that PPAR is a clock-controlled gene in the liver	
(7, 36). Control mice fed only during the night displayed a similar phase of hepatic clock gene expression and PPAR than mice fed ad libitum.

Next, we studied whether feeding time can also	
reset the phase of bmal1, per1, per3, and rev-erb	
expression in the absence of PPAR (Fig. 3B). Except	
the bmal1 expression, which was refractory to resetting, per1, per3, and rev-erb genes showed an inversed rhythm of their expression in the liver after	
daytime-restricted feeding compared with nighttime

results show that feeding time can reset the expression of per1, per3, and rev-erb in the liver of	
PPAR/ mice and suggest that bmal1 expression	
might be controlled by PPAR.	
Fenofibrate Induces Expression of Clock Genes	
in Rat-1 Fibroblasts and Up-Regulates bmal1	
Gene Expression in Liver	
Because PPAR presents a circadian expression in	
liver, we first studied whether a shock with a serumrich medium is able to induce an oscillation of PPAR	
in the well-established in vitro model Rat-1 fibroblasts	
(9, 13, 48–50). As shown in Fig. 4A, PPAR gene	
expression is induced by a serum shock in Rat-1 fibroblasts with a maximal level reached 12 h after the	
beginning of the treatment in comparison with the	
control. The induced-oscillating expressions of reverb and cry1 after serum shock were in accordance	
with previously reported data (9, 51). In addition, reverb expression is delayed (peak at 16 h after the	
serum shock treatment) compared with PPAR expression, which suggests that in Rat-1 fibroblasts	
PPAR induces rev-erb expression. Similarly to	
these observations, it seems likely that serum largely	
participates in the synchronization of the circadian	
oscillation of PPAR mRNA in fibroblast cultures.	
Fibrates are well-known activators of PPAR expression and are classical drugs used in the treatment	
of dyslipidemias. Using the same in vitro model, we	
then evaluated whether fenofibrate can induce expression of PPAR gene. The addition of fenofibrate into	
the serum-free medium triggered a rhythmic expression of PPAR peaking 12–14 h as observed after a	
serum treatment (Fig. 4B). Fenofibrate induced a	
PPAR expression 6-fold higher than serum (Fig. 4, A	
and B).	
Fenofibrate can also induce a rhythmic expression	
of clock genes. The temporal induction by fenofibrate	
of cry1, rev-erb, and bmal1 expression into the culture medium was almost similar to that observed after	
a serum-shock: cry1 mRNA level peaked at Zeitgeber	
time 8 (ZT8) to ZT10 (where ZT0 is time when the light	
switched on at 0700 h, and ZT12 is time when the light	
switched off at 1900 h), rev-erb at ZT16–ZT20, and	
bmal1 at ZT4 (Fig. 4C). Thus, fenofibrate can act as a	
Zeitgeber in cell culture and trigger a rhythm of clock	
gene expression.	
To determine whether fenofibrate can also reset the	
liver clock in vivo, the response of bmal1 and rev-erb	
genes to fenofibrate treatment was compared in liver	
of WT and PPAR/ mice (Fig. 4D). In accordance	
with our previous results, fenofibrate was also able to	
markedly induce bmal1 mRNA levels in control mice	
but not in PPAR-deficient mice, suggesting that	
bmal1 induction by fenofibrate is effectively mediated	
by PPAR. Similarly, as it was previously reported in	
rat liver and human hepatocytes (30, 43), administration of fenofibrate in WT mice significantly increased	
the rev-erb mRNA levels. As expected, rev-erb expression in PPAR knockout mice was not induced by	
fenofibrate, confirming that murine rev-erb induction	
by fenofibrate is mediated by PPAR. Taken together,	
these data strongly suggest that fenofibrate can alter	
the endogenous rhythm of the liver peripheral clock	
and in vivo.	
PPAR Is a Direct Regulator of bmal1 Expression	
To specify the regulation of bmal1 gene expression by	
PPAR suggested by our analysis of bmal1 expression	
in the PPAR/ mice, we analyzed the interaction of	
PPAR with the bmal1 promoter. First, we performed	
a bioinformatic research of potential PPAR binding	
sites (PPREs) on the bmal1 promoter region using the	
Nubiscan software. Two major PPREs were predicted	
at the positions 1519 (, TGGACATGGGTCA) and	
4943 (, AGGGCTGAGGACA), the start site corresponding to the one identified in mouse testis (52). To	
evaluate whether PPAR binds to the bmal1 gene	
promoter in vivo, the occupancy of the potential PPRE	
binding sites by PPAR was analyzed using chromatin	
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays performed on hepatocyte DNA using an anti-PPAR antibody (Fig. 5A).	
As previously shown in vitro, the DNA encompassing	
the rev-erb Rev-DR2 site (position 45) was precipitated in vivo by the anti-PPAR antibody after fibrate	
treatment (Fig. 5A, lower panel, lanes 7 and 9), in	
accordance	
with	
a	
PPAR-Rev-erb	
cross	
talk	
through competition for binding to the same Rev-DR2	
site (43). Moreover, an amplification product was observed when the same DNA samples were PCR-amplified using primers covering the PPRE located at the	
position 1519 in the bmal1 promoter (Fig. 5A, upper	
panel, lanes 7 and 9). No amplification product was	
obtained using primers flanking the site at the position	
4943 (middle panel). These data further demonstrate	
that in mice in vivo, PPAR directly binds to the PPRE	
site located at the position 1519 of the bmal1 promoter in peripheral oscillators and therefore that	
bmal1 is a direct PPAR target gene.	
PPAR mRNA Expression Is Severely DownRegulated in the Liver of bmal1/ Mice	
To test the hypothesis that the regulation of circadian	
PPAR expression involves bmal1 in the liver, we analyzed the daily accumulation of PPAR mRNA in the	
liver of bmal1/ mice by quantitative PCR. PPAR	
mRNA expression is rhythmic in bmal1/ mice with a	
maximum around ZT12 as observed in WT mice,	
whereas the amplitude of the peak of expression is	
significantly dampened (Fig. 5B). This result suggests	
that BMAL1 is an upstream regulator of PPAR gene	
and is consistent with the recent observation that	
PPAR expression is also CLOCK dependent (27).

DISCUSSION	
A New Regulatory Feedback Loop Involved	
BMAL1 and PPAR in Peripheral Clocks	
Molecular dissection of the mechanisms by which the	
clock oscillating system is controlled remains one of	
the most important challenges to assess the importance of the circadian regulation in diverse physiological and metabolic processes in mammals. In the	
present study, we have integrated the PPAR gene	
and its protein into a new positive-regulatory feedback	
loop in the liver. A model summarizing our main results	
is shown in Fig. 6. We show that PPAR plays an	
important role in the endogenous rhythmic property of	
peripheral clocks in vivo, whereas in the central clock	
PPAR deficiency does not alter the circadian expression of clock genes. These clock gene expressions are	
only affected in the liver of PPAR-deficient mice.	
First, PPAR is not essential to drive the central circadian system because PPAR/ mice entrained	
normally without arrhythmic behavior in constant darkness and displayed no alteration in the amplitude and	
the phase of circadian expression of the clock genes	
(bmal1, per2, per3, cry2, and rev-erb) compared with	
WT mice. The lack of PPAR-dependent clock regulation in vivo in the SCN can be due either to the	
absence of a circadian PPAR function in the central	
clock or to the presence of another isotype of PPAR (,	
) or other nuclear receptors that are able to bind to	
the PPRE site and to exert a compensatory effect.	
Second, the expression of bmal1, an essential gene of	
the molecular oscillator, is drastically reduced in the	
liver of PPAR-deficient mice. This regulation of bmal1	
transcription by PPAR is likely through a direct binding of PPAR to the PPRE element located at the	
position 1519 in the bmal1 promoter. In addition to	
the established transactivation of the circadian promoter rev-erb by PPAR (43), our data largely support the view that PPAR also associates with the

circadian bmal1 promoter in vivo. Interestingly, PPAR	
expression is strongly decreased in the liver of bmal1deficient mice compared with WT mice. Because no	
significant change in hepatic CLOCK level is found in	
bmal1-deficient mice compared with WT mice (53),	
this suggests that BMAL1 itself is in return involved in	
the circadian transactivation of PPAR gene at the	
level of peripheral oscillators in mice. Other observations have also revealed that CLOCK is involved in the	
circadian transactivation of PPAR (27) and interacts	
with its partner RXR (34). We propose that bmal1 is	
directly and positively regulated by PPAR and that	
BMAL1 imposes in return a circadian regulation on	
PPAR transcription.	
PPAR Expression Is Resetted by Feeding in	
Peripheral Clocks	
Liver is known to be the organ reacting most rapidly to	
the temporal feeding regimen because it plays a dominant role in the metabolism and processing of food	
components, such as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. It was clearly established that the circadian	
gene expression in peripheral hepatic cells is intimately connected to feeding (10, 11) and that PPAR	
is involved in food processing and energy homeostasis (45). A connection between circadian gene regulation, metabolism and energy homeostasis was also	
established. For example, glucose metabolism (e.g.	
6-phosphofructokinase-2,	
aldolase,	
and	
glucose	
phosphate isomerase) is under the control of the circadian time-keeping system (23, 24). Rhythmic expression of numerous enzymes and transcription factors involved in protein and amino acid metabolism	
(e.g. serine dehydratase, DBP, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) (7, 54), in fat metabolism (e.g. cholesterol 7-hydroxylase, PPAR, HMGCoA	
lyase	
and	
reductase)	
(7,	
35,	
55),	
or	
in	
detoxification process [e.g. steroid 15-hydroxylase	
(Cyp2a4)	
and	
coumarin

(Cyp2a5),	
Cyp2e1, Cyp17, and glutathione-S-transferase 2]	
(23, 56) was also observed in liver. Herein, we show	
that the circadian expression of PPAR is resetted by	
feeding time and that, in the absence of PPAR, clock	
Fig. 6. Model of Cross Talk between PPAR and Circadian Pathways Depicting the Control of Circadian Regulation by PPAR	
in Peripheral Clocks	
In mammals, circadian rhythms are generated by the main pacemaker located in the SCN of the hypothalamus, which	
synchronizes the peripheral oscillators and ensure an ordered response of the organism in terms of physiology, metabolism, and	
behavior to environmental changes. These peripheral clocks can be resetted by alternative routes such as feeding time. Herein,	
we show that PPAR is entirely resetted by feeding time. We propose that bmal1 transcription is directly positively regulated by	
PPAR and that BMAL1 imposes circadian regulation on PPAR transcription (bold arrows). The amplified accumulation of	
PPAR under fibrate treatment leads in turn to a higher level of expression of bmal1 gene (dashed arrows).

gene expression in liver is entrained by reversed feeding time, suggesting that PPAR does not play a major	
role in food resetting. We underline that, after an extended duration of daytime feeding, the food-imposed	
reversed phase of circadian gene expression in peripheral liver is similar between WT and PPAR-deficient mice. This is probably due to PPAR-independent signaling pathway that plays a major role in the	
phase resetting of circadian gene expression by feeding time.	
Fibrates as a Resetting Signal in Cell Cultures	
and Peripheral Clocks	
Previous studies have shown that PPAR expression	
is positively controlled by glucocorticoids and fibrates	
and negatively by insulin (37–39). Fibrates are also	
known to up-regulate the expression of rev-erb in the	
rat liver and in both rat and human primary hepatocyte	
cultures (30, 43). In vitro, PPAR mRNA was induced	
in rat fibroblasts culture after both a serum shock and,	
more interestingly, a fenofibrate treatment. Moreover,	
fenofibrate efficiently stimulates the rhythmic expression of several clock genes such as cry1, bmal1, and	
rev-erb. This suggests that fenofibrate is able to entrain rhythmic PPAR and clock gene expressions in	
Rat-1 fibroblasts. In vivo, rev-erb mRNA level is upregulated by fenofibrate in the mouse liver of WT animals. Because this up-regulation of rev-erb gene by	
fibrates is not observed in the PPAR-deficient mice,	
we confirm in vivo that the induction of rev-erb gene	
expression by fibrates is mediated by PPAR at the	
transcriptional level. Interestingly, the increased accumulation of PPAR after fibrate treatment leads in turn	
to a higher level of expression of bmal1 in WT mice.	
Other convincing evidence that the fibrate effect on	
the bmal1 expression is exerted at the transcriptional	
level via the PPAR protein is that fibrates have no	
effect on the bmal1 expression in the PPAR/ mice.	
Taken together, these results suggest that PPAR	
could play a role in integrating chemical signals inside	
the liver.	
How Circadian Rhythm Might Influence a	
Fibrate Therapy?	
To date, fibrates are clinically used as hypolipidemic	
drugs that lower plasma cholesterol and triglycerides.	
They exert their effect by regulating the expression of	
several key genes implicated in lipid metabolism via	
PPAR activation. Interestingly, fibrate therapy represents a cost-effective approach in the clinical management and the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in a growing population suffering from lifestyleinduced metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity,	
insulin resistance, and diabetes (57). Although important differences in lipid metabolism exist between	
mice and human, including the function of PPAR (58,	
59), our in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the	
regulation by fibrates of the circadian expression of	
clock genes may influence the success of a treatment	
because it would suggest a potential induction and	
subsequently a dysfunction of their expression after	
fibrate supply in patients. The validity of this hypothesis remains to be demonstrated in humans. Therefore, one additional question to address is how fibrate	
administration at a selected time of the day can impact	
the efficacy and the success of the treatment. It will be	
of interest to decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in the circadian expression of clock genes and	
PPAR-regulated genes in presence or absence of	
fibrates to provide new insight in the downstream circadian physiological and cellular processes governed	
by PPAR itself. Similarly, such understanding should	
lead to new strategies for pharmacological manipulation of the human clock to improve the treatment of	
dyslipidaemias.	
In summary, our data indicate that PPAR is a specific element of the liver oscillatory clock in mammals	
and plays an important role in integrating signals into	
the clock machinery. We clearly demonstrate that, in	
vivo, PPAR is required to maintain normal circadian	
oscillation of the master clock gene bmal1 in liver. This	
regulation occurs via a direct binding of PPAR on a	
PPRE located in the bmal1 promoter. In addition,	
BMAL1 is an upstream regulator of the PPAR expression. This finding provides a new regulatory pathway	
for the circadian system and suggests that some transcription factors may have a specific role in the peripheral clocks. Further studies are now required to	
determine the exact impact of circadian rhythms on	
the metabolic processes governed by PPAR in peripheral organs. This can be addressed by investigating the circadian regulation of PPAR target genes	
and some of the downstream targets in the peripheral	
clock in WT, PPAR/, and other clock mutant mice.	
The complete elucidation of the signaling elements	
involved in the interactions between central and peripheral clocks and the mechanisms that govern the	
interplay between metabolism and circadian oscillators will also have a major impact on the circadian field

Cell Culture, Serum, and Fibrate Shock	
Rat-1 fibroblasts were grown in DMEM supplemented with	
5% fetal calf serum and a mixture of penicillin/streptomycin/	
glutamine (PSG). The serum shock was done as described	
elsewhere using 50% horse serum (9). For the fibrate shock,	
the medium was exchanged with DMEM-PSG supplemented	
with 50 M fenofibrate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) after the cells	
reach confluence (time 0). This medium was replaced with	
fenofibrate-free DMEM-PSG medium after 2 h. At 0, 4, 8, 12,	
16, 20, 24 h after shock, cells were lysed and kept at 70 C	
until RNA extraction. Whole-cell RNAs were extracted using	
GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Extraction kit from Sigma.

Animal Experiments	
Purebred WT and homozygous PPAR/ mice on an SV129	
background were used. All experiments were done with male	
mice between 6 and 8 wk of age. Animals were kept under a	
12L:12D cycle, and food and drinking water were available ad	
libitum, except when indicated otherwise. The experimental	
protocols of the current research were approved by the rules	
and regulations of French veterinary services.	
Locomotor Activity Recording	
Adult male mice (n  8 for both WT and PPAR/) were	
exposed to 12L:12D cycle for at least 2 wk. For monitoring	
locomotor activity, mice were housed individually in cages	
equipped with infrared motion captors placed over the cages	
and a computerized data acquisition system (Circadian Activity Monitoring System, Institut National de la Sante´ et de la	
Recherche Me´ dicale, France). Activity records were analyzed	
with the Clocklab software package (Actimetrics, Evanston,	
IL). For each animal, the total duration of activity was determined every 2 or 12 h during the LD cycle and then averaged	
for WT and knockout mice. Animals were then allowed to free	
run in constant darkness (DD) for at least 15 d. The endogenous period in DD was subsequently determined using the	
Clocklab software.	
Circadian Expression of Clock Genes in Wild-Type vs.	
PPAR/ Mice	
Twelve WT and 12 PPAR/ mice were maintained for a	
period of 2 wk in a 12L:12D cycle and transferred in DD the	
day before the kill. Livers and SCN were removed at CT1,	
CT8, CT14, and CT21; stored at 70 C until RNA extraction;	
and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. The experiment was	
done twice.	
Restricted Feeding	
Mice (n  24 both for WT and PPAR/) fed during the day	
received food when light was on (0700 to 1900 h), whereas	
mice (n  24 both for WT and PPAR/) fed during the night	
received food from 1900 to 0700 h for 2 wk. Water was freely	
available over the experimental period. As controls, WT and	
PPAR/ mice (n  24 for both) were fed ad libitum. Mice	
were transferred in DD the day before killing. Livers were	
dissected at indicated circadian times (CT1, CT8, CT14,	
CT21), stored at 70 C until RNA extraction, and analyzed by	
quantitative-RT-PCR.	
Fenofibrate Response	
In this experiment, mice (n  32 both for WT and PPAR/)	
were treated for 2 wk with fenofibric acid (vehicle DMSO)	
mixed in the drinking water at the final concentration of 7 mM.	
Control animals (n  32 both for WT and PPAR/) were	
treated with vehicle in the drinking water. Livers were removed at CT1, CT8, CT14, and CT21, stored at 70 C until	
RNA extraction, and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR.	
Analysis of bmal1/ Mice	
WT and homozygous bmal1/ mice on B6 background	
(both females and males aged from 8–14 wk provided by C.	
Bradfield, McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) were kept under 12L:12D	
cycles and fed ad libitum. Livers were removed at indicated	
Zeitgeber time. Reverse-transcribed total RNAs from three to	
five animals per time point were analyzed by quantitative	
RT-PCR as described below.	
RNA Extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR	
Total RNAs were prepared from cells or from organs according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma) and reverse	
transcribed using random primers and MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). cDNA were then used	
as template for a quantitative real-time PCR assay using the	
QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR reagents (Qiagen, Valencia,	
CA) and the DNA Engine Opticon system (MJ Research,	
Cambridge, MA). Each couple of oligonucleotides used were	
designed to hybridize on different exons. The sequences of	
forward and reverse primers were as follows: bmal1, forward,	
5-CCAAGAAAGTATGGACACAGACAAA-3; bmal1, reverse,	
5-GCATTCTTGATCCTTCCTTGGT-3; cry1, forward, 5-CTGGCGTGGAAGTCATCGT-3; cry1, reverse, 5-CTGTCCGCCATTGAGTTCTATG-3; cry2, forward, 5-TGTCCCTTCCTGTGTGGAAGA-3; cry2, reverse, 5-GCTCCCAGCTTGGCTTGAA-3; per1, forward, 5-GGAGACCACTGAGAGCAGCAAG-3; per1, reverse, 5-CGCACTCAGGAGGCTGTAGGC-3;

The efficiency (95%) and the specificity of the amplification were controlled by generating standard curves and carrying out melting curves and agarose gels of the amplicons,	
respectively. The relative levels of each RNA were calculated	
by 2CT (CT standing as the cycle number in which SYBR	
Green fluorescence exceeds a constant threshold value) and	
normalized to the corresponding noncyclic 36B4 RNA levels.	
The presented values are means  SEM of duplicates of the	
same reaction for at least three different mice or three experimental points.	
The significance of differences was assessed by distribution-free two-way ANOVA. Paired Student’s tests were used	
to compare WT and PPAR/ or bmal1/ mice. Results are	
presented as mean  SEM. Differences were considered significant when P  0.05.	
ChIP Assays	
ChIP experiments were performed as already described in	
Ijpenberg et al. (60). Briefly, WT and PPAR/ mice (n  3)	
were fed for 5 d with either Wy14,643 (50 mg/kgd) or vehicle.	
Immunoprecipitation of liver extracts was done using a	
PPAR antibody and the immunoprecipitated DNA was PCR	
amplified using primers flanking either the rev-erb Rev-DR2	
(GTGTCACTGGGGC) or potential PPRE (usually AGGTCANAGGTCA) on the bmal1 promoter predicted using the	
computer program NUBISCAN available at the following	
website: www.nubiscan.unibas.ch (61). An equal volume of	
nonprecipitated genomic DNA (Input) was amplified as positive control. One fifth of PCR products were separated on an	
ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel.

A prospective study of Candida esophagitis was undertaken to determine the spectrum 	
of this disease in a general hospital. During 1 year, in 370 consecutive endoscopies, 27 	
patients with Candida esophagitis were detected. The diagnosis was established by 	
finding white plaques on endoscopy, yeast organisms on microscopic examination of a 	
direct smear from the plaques, and a serum agglutinin titer of at least 1: 160. Of these 27 	
patients, 14 had esophageal symptoms. Twelve patients were reendoscoped after 	
nystatin or nystatin and tlucytosine therapy. Nine patients showed absence of lesions, a 	
negative smear, and disappearance of symptoms. Control patients had no plaques on 	
endoscopy. no yeast organisms on microscopical examination of esophageal brushings. 	
and a positive titer in 4 to 17% of cases. A minimal agglutinin titer of 1:160 was found in 	
4 to 12% of two additional groups of controls. Absence of titer precluded a diagnosis of 	
Candida esophagitis. 	
Candida infection of the esophagus has been considered a relatively uncommon though specific disease 	
entitity. suspected primarily in symptomatic patients 	
with oral thrush or underlying debilitating diseases. 1-4 	
Radiological examination by\barium swallow· and esophageal biopsy' have been the principal diagnostic procedures. Other endoscopic findings have been rePorted I. • but not emphasized as a method of diagnosis. 	
A prospective study was undertaken to determine the 	
SPectrum of Candida esophagitis at Maimonides Medical Center. 	
Patients and Methods 	
During the calendar year of 197:1. there were 20,688 general 	
hospital admissions, 688 clinic, and 775 private outpatient 	
referrals to the Gastroenterology service. Of the patient population, 90% came from a white middle class socioeconomic 	
background. For investigation of upper gastrointestinal symptOms. :170 patients underwent esophagoj(astroduodenoscopy;

267 were hospital inpatients, 47 were clinic patients, and S6 	
were private outpatients. The mean age of t he patients was 60 	
years with a range of 17 to 90 years and a male to female fatio of 	
4::1. All patients had a complete history. physical examination. 	
complete blood count. urinalysis, SMA 12/60 (AutoAnalvzer. 	
Technicon Instruments Corp., Tarrytown. N. Y.) ehest films, 	
and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. 	
Twenty-seven patients were suspected of having Candida 	
esophagitis by gross appearance at endoscopy. The esophagitis 	
was graded on a scale of I to IV; grade I. a few raised white 	
"plaques up to 2 mm"" in size with hyperemia but no edema or "	
ulceration (fig. 1); grade II. multiple raised white plaques 	
greater than 2 mm in size with hyperemia, edema, but no 	
ulceration (fig. 2); grade III. confluent. linear. and nodular 	
elevated plaques with hyperemia and frank ulceration (fig. :I); 	
grade IV. finding of grade III with increased friability of the 	
mucous membranes and occasional narrowing of the lumen 	
(fig. 4). 	
The plaques were brushed, and direct smears and cultures 	
were made from these brushings. The slides were air dried. A 	
wet mount was prepared by adding a drop of either distilled 	
water or 10% potassium hydroxide in the presence of excess

mucus (fig. 5). Cultures were made on Nickerson's medium 	
and the species were determined by germ tube fermentation, 	
carbohydrate fermentation, and nitrogen assimilation techniques. The brush was first cultured to detect prior contamination with fungi. The biopsy channel was washed with soap 	
solution and 95% ethyl alcohol after each procedure and the 	
effluents were periodically cultured to detect the presence of 	
fungi. A minimum of two biopsies were taken from the 	
esophageal plaques and from the intervening areas. Histological specimens were examined after staining by hematoxylin 	
and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff methods. Brushings, biopsies, and cultures were taken from 15 patients with the 	
appearance of reflux esophagitis and from 18 patients with a 	
normal-appearing esophagus. 	
Sera from 27 suspected cases of Candida esophagitis, 100 	
asymptomatic hospital employees, 164 random in-hospital 	
patients, 18 patients with a normal esophagus at endoscopy, 	
and 12 patients with reflux esophagitis were tested for Candida 	
agglutinins and precipitins.· Quantitative serum immunoglobulins were determined in 14 of the 27 patients with Candida 	
esophagitis. 	
Esophagograms were performed in 25 patients suspected to 	
have Candida esophagitis, owing to the endoscopic appearance 	
and mycological findings. 	
Twenty-four of the 27 patients were treated for 6 weeks with 	
nystatin (Mycostatin, E. R. Squibb & Sons, Princeton, N. J.), 	
200,000 units, as a combined gargle and swallow every 1 to 2 hr 	
while awake. 7 Three patients were not treated because they 	
required emergency surgery. Four patients with persistent 	
symptoms had supplementary flucytosine (Ancobon, Roche 	
Laboratories, Nutley, N. J.) orally (100 mg per kg of body 	
weight per day in four divided doses after meals for 4 to 6 	
weeks).· Weekly complete blood counts and SMA 12/60 	
procedures were performed to detect any untoward effects of 	
treatment. Of 14 patients with dysphagia or odynophagia 12 	
were reendoscoped after treatment 1 to 6 times to evaluate the 	
effect of therapy. 	
Results 	
Of the 370 patients who underwent endoscopy, 55 had 	
hyperemia of the esophagus, predominantly of the lower 	
third. Twenty-seven had elevated white plaques: 7 were 	
classified as grade I, 12 as grade II, 6 as grade III, and 2 	
as grade IV Candida esophagitis (table 1). The plaques 	
were absent in the upper third of the esophagus in all but 	
2 cases; 1 had oral thrush, the 2nd had no oral lesions.

the 2'7 patients were duodenal ulcer (6), gastric ulcer (5), 	
erosive gastritis (4), normal upper gastrointestinal tract 	
(4), hiatus hernia (3), atrophic gastritis (3), and partial 	
gastrectomy (2). Direct smears and cultures from the 	
white plaques were positive for Candida in each case. 	
Direct smears were negative in all 15 patients with reflux 	
esophagitis and in 18 patients with a normal·appearing 	
esophagus; however, Candida was cultured from 6 and 	
12 patients, respectively. Serum Candida agglutinin 	
titers of 1: 160 or greater were present in 100% of the 27 	
patients with white plaques, and in 4 to 17% of four 	
Control groups (table 2). Candida precipitin titers were 	
not helpful in the diagnosis. Serum immunoglobulins 	
Were diffusely elevated in 1 patient and normal in 1:3 of 	
14 patients studied. 	
The biopsies in all 27 patients with white plaques 	
showed acute and chronic inflammatory changes. How, 	
ever, Candida invasion of the mUCosa was seen only in 3 	
of the 8 patients with grade III or IV esophagitis. In the 	
15 patients with reflux esophagitis, the biopsies showed 	
acute and chronic inflammation with thickening of the 	
basal layer and the absence of Candida. The biopsies of 	
all 18 patients with a normal·appearing esophagus were 	
normal. 	
The esophagograms were reviewed by staff radiologists 	
and one of the authors (B. K.). Findings suggestive of 	
Candida esophagitis were absent. In the severe cases

Discussion 	
Candida esophagitis has been recognized to be not an 	
uncommon autopsy finding' particularly in oncological 	
institutions. I Eras et a1. I mentioned that this antemortem diagnosis was frequently missed in a review of 2517 	
autopsy protocols from an oncological institution. They 	
found histologically proven Candida esophagitis in 45 	
cases. Of these, 14 had a barium study attempted within 	
4 weeks of deaths; 3 had abnormal esophagograms, 5 	
were inadequate, and 6 were normal despite the presence 	
of severe esophagitis. In another oncological institution, 	
Jensen et al. 1 studied 98 patients with oral thrush by 	
endoscopy. barium swallow, and culture. They found 	
esophagitis in 35 patients with a positive culture for 	
Candida in all of them. The barium swallow was 	
abnormal in 24 of the 32 patients studied. The majority 	
of these patients were in poor condition. Moulinier et a1.· 	
collected 40 cases of Candida esophagitis that were 	
diagnosed by endoscopy. They noted difficulty in demonstrating X-ray abnormalities and they were able to 	
find yeast cells in only half of the biopsies. 	
The early stages of Candida esophagitis were more 	
readily identified in this prospective study by endoscopy, direct smears, and Candida agglutinin titers. A 	
careful, detailed history was important, inasmuch as 	
symptoms were mild to moderate. Further, the gradation of the endoscopic appearance correlated well with 	
the presence or absence of symptoms (table 1). A direct 	
smear from the plaques was consistently positive for 	
Candida, whereas a direct smear from patients with 	
reflux esophagitis was consistently negative. In contrast, 	
cultures for Candida were positive in both reflux and 	
Candida esophagitis patients. Cultures are useful in 	
determining the species and drug sensitivity but do not 	
distinguish the pathogen from the commensal in the 	
esophagus. A minimal agglutinin titer of 1:160 was 	
present in every patient with the characteristic endoscopic appearance and a positive direct smear for 	
Candida. A similar agglutinin titer was present in only 4 	
to 17% of four groups of controls. Such an agglutinin titer 	
may be due to Candida infection in other organs or past 	
infection and is, therefore, not diagnostic of Candida 	
esophagitis. However, a titer of less than 1:160 militates 	
against such a diagnosis.

Esophageal brushings more readily demonstrated 	
Candida than did biopsies. Superficially situated Candida in the less severe form may be washed away in the 	
fixing process. Biopsy sections from Candida and reflux 	
esophagitis are indistinguishable except for the presence 	
of Candida, which was noted in only 10% of the former. 	
In the absence of a predisposing illness, Candida 	
esophagitis is mainly a disease of the elderly. Impairment of three physiological processes may playa role in 	
the pathogenesis of the disease. The first is impaired 	
immunity, both cellular 10 and humoral; 11 the second 	
is impaired esophageal motility; 11 and the third is impaired carbohydrate metabolism 13, .. associated with 	
aging. 	
Candida esophagitis should always be considered in 	
the differential diagnosis of dysphagia and odynophagia. 	
Endoscopy, direct smear, and agglutinin titers are more 	
valuable diagnostic aids than are the esophagogram and 	
biopsy. Inasmuch as nystatin therapy is simple, safe, 	
and effective, it is recommended in the treatment of 	
Candida esophagitis. 	
Addendum 	
From January 1,1974 to June 30,1975,1065 additional 	
patients were endoscoped; 136 patients had hyperemia 	
of the lower third of the esophagus, 61 with white 	
plaques and 75 without plaques (reflux esophagitis). 	
Each patient with white plaques had a positive direct 	
smear for yeasts. Thirty of the 61 patients were tested for 	
agglutinin titers and each had a titer of 1:160 or greater. 	
Candida invasion was seen microscopically in 5 of 56 	
patients that were biopsied. All 5 had grade III or IV 	
involvement. The upper third of the esophagus was 	
spared in all cases except 3. Two had an underlying 	
disease that may predispose to Candida esophagitis, 	
chronic lymphocytic leukemia in one and a severe long 	
standing diabetes in the other. Oral thrush was present 	
in only these 2 patients and not in the rest of the patients 	
with Candida esophagitis. Of 61 patients with Candida

ABSTRACT	
Candida albicans is by far the most common cause of infectious esophagitis. In most patients, this infection is 	
secondary to an immuno-compromised state. In nearly 25% of the cases, underlying causes of esophageal stasis, 	
e.g., achalasia and scleroderma, facilitate fungal colonization of the esophagus. Double contrast esophagography 	
is a highly sensitive tool for diagnosing candida esophagitis. This report discusses the uncommon association 	
of Candida esophagitis with achalasia cardia, their radiographic features and a short review of the available 	
literature.

INTRODUCTION	
Candida esophagitis most frequently develops 	
in immunocompromised patients but occasionally 	
it complicates food stasis in patients with achalasia, 	
scleroderma or peptic stricture.[1] The association of achalasia 	
with Candida esophagitis is quite uncommon and an early 	
diagnosis is mandated for adequate treatment of both these 	
entities and for preventing the risk of metaplasia.[2] Real 	
time barium swallow is the modality of choice to depict 	
the manifestations of altered physiology in achalasia and 	
supplement the findings of manometry.[3] In addition, a 	
double contrast barium esophagogram can help assess the 	
mucosal pathology caused by candidiasis and taper down 	
the differential diagnosis.[3] Endoscopy with sampling for 	
cytological / microbiological evaluation is however, the 	
conclusive way to establish the diagnosis. 	
CASE REPORT	
We report a 45 year old male who presented with dysphagia 	
both to solids and liquids for the last two years with which 	
occasional odynophagia, intermittent regurgitation and 	
aspiration were associated. There was also a complaint of 	
fever, chest pain and significant weight loss for the last one 	
year. Past history of the patient was non-contributory and 	
there was no history suggestive of immunosuppression. 	
General physical examination was unremarkable except for 	
pallor and mild hepatomegaly. Oral mucosa, skin and nails 	
were healthy. Chest X-ray showed absent gastric fundal 	
air bubble, widened superior mediastinum, straightened 	
right mediastinal border with an air fluid level in the upper 	
mediastinum. On the basis of clinical and chest radiographic 	
findings, a provisional diagnosis of achalasia cardia was 	
made. Single and double contrast barium esophagography 	
using barium sulphate suspension (Microbar HD Eskay fine 	
chemicals, Mumbai, India) was done under fluoroscopic 	
control using a standard protocol. Filming was done in 	
the erect position for the double contrast and in the prone 	
position for single contrast studies. These studies showed 	
grossly dilated esophagus almost along its entire length 	
with gradual tapering at its lower end with slow and delayed 	
passage of barium through the gastro-esophageal (GE) 	
junction into the stomach, resembling a bird’s beak or a 	
rat’s tail typical of achalasia cardia. Primary and secondary 	
peristaltic waves were absent with tertiary contractions being 	
the major peristaltic waves in esophagus. “Milking effect” 	
was seen at the gastro-esophageal junction. A suspicion 	
of mucosal irregularity was raised for which a double 	
contrast study was done which revealed the presence of 	
multiple small ulcers with mucosal nodularity [Figure 1]. 	
On performing upper gastro-intenstinal endoscopy, the 	
findings of the barium examination were confirmed. The GE 	
junction was tight suggestive of motor dysphagia with white

patches along the entire length of the esophagus [Figure 	
2]. The esophageal mucosa had a friable, erythematous 	
appearance with multiple small ulcers located in relation to 	
the white plaques. Stomach and duodenum were normal. 	
Microbiologic cultures of brushings obtained from the 	
esophagus were positive for candidiasis. A manometeric 	
examination followed by graded balloon dilatations of the 	
esophagus for treatment of achalasia was conducted. The 	
patient was put on antifungal therapy and was improving till 	
the last outpatient attendance. Follow up clinical, imaging 	
and endoscopic pictures revealed resolution of fungal 	
etiology and reduction in severity of achalasia cardia.	
DISCUSSION	
Candida albicans is by far the most common cause of 	
infectious esophagitis. Most patients with Candida 	
esophagitis are immunocompromised as a result of 	
underlying malignancy, AIDS or treatment with radiation, 	
chemotherapy, steroids or other cytotoxic agents.[2] In nearly 	
25% of the cases, conditions like achalasia cardia, scleroderma 	
etc. cause esophageal stasis that facilitate fungal colonization 	
of the esophagus with subsequent esophagitis.[1] Prolonged 	
untreated achalasia was the predisposing condition for 	
candidial infection in the present report as discussed by 	
Holt.[4]	
Achalasia cardia is a motor disorder of esophagus generally 	
occurring in the 35-50 year old age group. It is caused 	
by degeneration of neurons in the Auerbach’s plexus 	
leading to failure of primary and secondary peristalses. 	
Tertiary contractions subsequently develop with failure of 	
relaxation of lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Both these 	
factors together lead to stasis of food and secretions in the 	
esophagus, which when prolonged may get complicated with 	
growth of Candida albicans leading to Candida esophagitis.[2] 	
The esophagus may undergo marked dilation with a tortuous 	
course (i.e., sigmoid-shaped esophagus).[5]	
Radiographically, as in our case, an esophagus with severe 	
and long standing achalasia may form fluid levels and 	
a foamy appearance in the mediastinum on plain chest 	
film.[1] The right mediastinal border is straightened or even 	
deviated laterally. Primary and secondary peristalses are 	
absent on single contrast swallow with appearance of tertiary 	
contractions in the lower half of esophagus. The incomplete 	
opening of LES is depicted in the barium study as a sharp, 	
smooth, tapered segment at the lower end of esophagus, 	
described as a “rat tail” or “bird beak appearance”.[2] A dilated 	
esophagus is often seen and may have a “sigmoid appearance” 	
in late phases.[5] Achalasia cardia must be differentiated from 	
other causes of narrowing occurring at the lower end of 	
esophagus such as peptic stricture, neoplasm, complicated 	
scleroderma, Chagas’ disease and postvagotomy effect. In the 	
present case, prolonged accumulation of food and secretions 	
secondary to achalasia cardia, led to candidial colonization 	
and esophagitis which was confirmed by a double contrast 	
esophagogram and endoscopy. 	
A double contrast barium study has been shown to have 	
sensitivity of 90% in the diagnosis of mucosal pathology 	
including Candida esophagitis.[1,3] It is usually manifested as 	
linear or irregular plaque-like lesions separated by segments 	
of normal intervening mucosa. In more advanced disease, 	
coalescent plaques may produce a “cobblestone” or “snake 	
skin” appearance. There may be trapping of barium in 	
between plaques and pseudomembranes.[1] Differentials 	
of Candida esophagitis include herpes esophagitis, reflux

esophagitis, artifacts from air bubbles and residual adherent 	
food particles.[2,4] The endoscopy of this patient showed the 	
presence of a bubbly foam filling the esophagus adherent to 	
its wall. The underlying mucosa was friable and erythematous 	
with punctate ulcers at a few sites. These are the classical 	
findings described in literature for Candida esophagitis.[1]	
 	
Although the development of candidiasis in the obstructed 	
esophagus is uncommon, some literature reviews and 	
infrequent case reports suggest such an association. This 	
report reinforces the facts that long-standing stasis in the 	
esophagus can lead to secondary opportunistic infective 	
esophagitis, Candida being the most common. Single and 	
double contrast esophagogram can diagnose these conditions 	
accurately thus helping in early installation of antifungal 	
therapy. We wish to highlight the occurrence of candidiasis 	
in the presence of esophageal obstruction in our case which 	
is consistent with many reported in literature and to illustrate 	
the radiological findings in these cases.

Case Report	
A 74‑year‑old woman presented with 1‑year history of 	
recurrent total dysphagia, which was sudden in onset and 	
episodic. There was no history of ingestion of a corrosive 	
substance, esophageal instrumentation, GERD or fever. 	
There was no odynophagia. There was no history of 	
chest pain, regurgitation, any underlying malignancy or 	
immunosuppression. Furthermore, there was no positive 	
history of radiation therapy or chemotherapy in the past. She 	
had significant weight loss and she was a known hypertensive 	
on medication. The physical examination was essentially 	
normal and a clinical assessment of dysphagia secondary to 	
diffuse esophageal spasm was made.	
There was no abnormality detected on chest radiograph. The 	
single contrast barium swallow study showed narrowing of 	
about 10 cm segment in the middle third of the esophagus 	
commencing at 20 cm from incisors teeth with contrast filled 	
fine out‑pouches giving a “feathery” appearance [Figure 1]. 	
There was no hold‑up or reflux of contrast on fluoroscopy. 	
There was no diffuse discrete mucosal plaques, cobblestone, 	
Introduction	
Candida albicans is the most common cause of infectious 	
esophagitis.[1] It usually occurs as an opportunistic infection 	
in immunocompromised patients.[2]	
The characteristic appearance of Candida esophagitis on 	
barium studies is that of diffuse discrete mucosal plaques, 	
which may become confluent to form cobblestone or shaggy 	
esophagus.[1‑3] Several authors have reported uncommon 	
manifestations which include foamy appearance, aphthous 	
ulceration, stricture, fistula, and polypoid masses.[2,3]	
The “feathery” appearance is described in this case as a new 	
manifestation of Candida esophagitis. This appearance is 	
similar to what was described as pseudo‑diverticulosis in

The characteristic appearance of Candida esophagitis on barium studies is that of diffuse discrete mucosal plaques, which may become 	
confluent to form 'cobblestone or shaggy' esophagus. Many authors have also reported different radiographic findings such as a foamy 	
appearance in florid esophageal candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. This report discusses a “feathery” appearance seen 	
in barium esophagography of a 74‑year‑old woman who presented with dysphagia. The barium swallow showed fine out- pouching 	
giving a “feathery” appearance, which is similar to what is described as pseudo‑diverticulosis in patients with esophagitis complicating 	
gastro‑esophageal reflux disease. A diagnosis of esophagitis presumably due to candidiasis was made. This was confirmed by fungal 	
studies on biopsy specimen following flexible esophagoscopy. Radiologists should be aware of this rare manifestation as a new sign 	
of Candida esophagitis in order to avoid unnecessary delay in diagnosis and treatment.

foamy or shaggy appearance of the esophagus. Chest 	
computerized tomography scan showed thickened esophageal 	
wall limited to the involved segment. A  diagnosis of 	
esophagitis was made based on the “feathery” appearance 	
on barium swallow studies.	
Flexible esophagoscopy showed whitish patches in the middle 	
third of the esophagus that bled on contact [Figure 2]. The 	
underlying mucosa was friable and erythematous. There was no 	
mass lesion seen and the probe was advanced to the stomach. 	
Samples obtained from the esophagus were taken and sent for 	
histology and fungal studies, which revealed chronic esophagitis 	
and C. albicans respectively. Lentiviral screening was negative.	
The patient was commenced on oral fluconazole because 	
amphotericin B was not available. She tolerated semi‑solid 	
food about 2 weeks after the commencement of the therapy 	
and normal diet a month after.	
Discussion	
Candida colonization of the esophagus occurs in 25.0% of 	
healthy individuals.[5] However, invasive Candida esophageal 	
infections predominantly occur in immunocompromised and 	
transplant patients or after a major surgical procedure.[5]	
During the past two decades, a much more fulminant form 	
of candidiasis has been encountered in patients with AIDS, 	
who may present with grossly irregular or “shaggy” esophagus 	
caused by innumerable coalescent pseudomembranes and 	
plaques, with trapping of barium between the lesions.[1]	
Although, a “shaggy” barium‑filled esophagus with ragged 	
irregular contour is thought to be characteristic of candidiasis, 	
this finding is present only in patients with advanced 	
disease.[6] Other radiographic finding which may be seen 	
in more advanced disease is coalescent plaques, which may 	
produce a “cobblestone” or “snakeskin” appearance.[2,7]	
In our case, the patient was not immunocompromised 	
as evidenced by the negative HIV screening and had no 	
previous instrumentation or surgical intervention. The 	
“feathery” appearance described, in this case, was seen in an 	
immunocompetent patient. This may explain why the disease 	
condition did not progress to the advanced stage 1‑year after 	
the commencement of the symptoms.	
The pathophysiology that accounts for this pseudodiverticulosis (feathery appearance) is unclear. This may 	
be due to inflammatory changes induced by the Candida 	
infection. Its specificity for Candida esophagitis has not been 	
established. However, if found the patient must be further 	
evaluated for Candida esophagitis. Endoscopy with sampling 	
for cytological/microbiological evaluation is however, the 	
conclusive way to establish the diagnosis.[7]	
Sam et al. described a foamy esophagus as a new sign of 	
Candida esophagitis on double contrast esophagography 	
which is characterized by innumerable tiny, rounded 	
bubbles that settle out along the top of the barium column, 	
producing a layer of foam.[2] It was inferred that this foamy 	
esophagus may be more likely to occur in patients with chronic 	
esophageal candidiasis from esophageal stasis associated 	
with scleroderma or other causes of functional or mechanical 	
obstruction of the esophagus. Feathery appearance seen 	
in this case is a new sign of chronic Candida esophagitis. It 	
is demonstrated on single contrast esophagography in an 	
immunocompetent patient with no features of connective 	
tissue disorder or functional esophageal obstruction.	
Conclusion	
Many patients will still continue to be examined initially by 	
barium esophagography, and some patients such as those 	
with AIDS whose endoscopy represents a risk of disease 	
transmission to other patients, may not be considered 	
candidates for more invasive study. It is important therefore,

Abstract	
A 75-year-old woman who had been healthy except for mild glycemia and lipidemia discovered three and	
a half months before admission experienced severe dysphagia secondary to oral and esophageal candidiasis.	
She eventually developed diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome and ketoacidosis. Since anti-GAD antibody was	
negative and her diabetes was controlled with a moderate dose of insulin, we made a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Her only risk factors for candidiasis were hyperglycemia, age, and continuous denture use. The fact	
that her diabetes developed in association with oral candidiasis supports the hypothesis that there is a bidirectional interrelationship between diabetes and oral infection.	
Key words: denture, candidiasis, hyperosmolar syndrome, ketoacidosis	
(DOI: 10.2169/internalmedicine.46.1898)	
Introduction	
Candidiasis is one of the most common infections associated with diabetes. Most of the cases of diabetes-related	
candidiasis reported in Japan have been associated with	
chronic poor glycemic control (usually for years) and secondary factors such as 1) use of immunosuppressants, 2) malignant disease, 3) administration of intravenous hyperalimentation, and 4) antibiotic use. Below we report a case of	
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes accompanied by severe oral	
candidiasis and esophageal candidiasis (OC and EC, respectively), in which there was an evidence that the diabetes and	
clinically evident Candida infection both developed within a	
short interval in the absence of any of the well-known secondary factors mentioned above.	
Case Report	
The patient was a 75-year-old woman who was found to	
have mild glycemia (fasting plasma glucose 117 mg/dl),	
mildly elevated hemoglobin A1c level (6.0%), and moderate	
lipidemia (total cholesterol 234 mg/dl, and fasting triglyceride 329 mg/dl) during an annual health checkup in early	
January 2005, but who was otherwise healthy. Her height	
was 151 cm, and body weight was 47 kg at the time of the	
checkup. She never smoked, rarely drank alcohol, and had	
no noteworthy medical history except for cataract surgery at	
70 years of age and a cutaneous herpes zoster infection at	
65 years of age. Her father died of laryngeal cancer, but	
there was no other family history of major illness. Notably,	
she had hardly any teeth and wore dentures almost constantly.	
In early April 2005, she started a series of domestic trips	
and began to experience fatigue, thirst, and dysphagia during her trips. She had lost 5 kg in one week. In mid-April,	
her dysphagia became so severe that she could not eat solid	
food and could only drink water. A few days later, she went	
to a clinic by herself, and the physician noted very dry skin,	
a white coating in her mouth, fissured tongue, and signs of	
extreme exhaustion. Esophageal cancer was suspected. Gastric fiberscopy was performed the next day, and glucose was	
infused (approximately 16 g of glucose) during the examination. The examination revealed severe candidiasis of oral	
mucosa, larynx, and entire esophagus. The diagnosis of candidiasis was confirmed by staining esophageal specimens,	
and amphotericin B syrup was prescribed. The next evening,	
the patient was transferred to our hospital because she was	
confused and had a gait disturbance.	
The patient soon lapsed into hypovolemic shock, and a

Figure 1. Clinical Course. The dysphagia improved and 	
the patient resumed oral feeding prior to administration of

she was referred to another hospital for follow-up. GF: gastric fiberscopy; DIV: drip infusion of regular insulin; R+N:

drip infusion was started immediately. Her body temperature	
was 36.5℃, and physical examination revealed a white coating of the oral cavity and severe dehydration. Her chest and	
heart were normal to auscultation, and no masses were	
found in the abdomen. We failed to notice the condition of	
her dentures because of the emergency admission.	
Laboratory data showed severe hyperglycemia (plasma	
glucose 1,369 mg/dl), an elevated HbA1c level (10.6%), and	
renal dysfunction (Table 1). Serum lactate was mildly increased and the anion gap was very high (32.4 mEq/l).	
There was moderate acidemia (pH=7.196), and plasma osmotic pressure deduced from serum sodium, potassium,	
BUN, and glucose was very high (398 mOsm/l). Based on	
these findings, a diagnosis of diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome complicated by ketoacidosis was made.	
Antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor were negative, and the immunoglobulin G level was within the normal	
range. A chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan did not show	
any abnormal findings, such as malignant disease or an abscess. An eye examination showed no evidence of diabetic	
retinopathy or fungal endophthalmitis, and Candida septicemia was ruled out by the blood culture and Candida antigen	
test. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody was	
negative. Urinary C-peptide excretion was impaired at first	
(8.3 μg/day), but after intensive insulin therapy it recovered	
to 33.1 μg/day (Table 1). The dysphagia improved even after	
discontinuation of amphotericin B syrup, and it was possible	
to resume oral feeding at the end of the month. However,	
the C-reactive protein value rose on day 5 (Fig. 1), and fluconazole was administered orally until the middle of the	
next month. Since glycemic control had improved, bedtime	
insulin was discontinued, and the patient was discharged on	
three injections of regular insulin a day (6 units before	
breakfast and 4 units each before lunch and dinner).	
Her final visit to our hospital was on day 34, and she was	
referred to another local hospital at that time. Her diabetes	
has been well controlled with twice daily injections of a	
mixed type of insulin (30% of insulin aspart and 70% of insulin aspart protamine suspension), 8 units before breakfast	
and 4 units before dinner, and her hemoglobin A1c level	
was 6.5% at the 9-month follow-up examination. There have	
been no recurrences of the OC or EC. Since 1) anti-GAD	
antibody was not detected, 2) the urinary C-peptide excretion had recovered to a level that showed her diabetes was	
not insulin dependent, and 3) her diabetes control was stable	
on a moderate dose of insulin, the final diagnosis was type	
2 diabetes.	
Discussion	
We have summarized the cases of glycemia-related OC	
and EC reported in Japan from 1995 to 2004 in Table 2. Except for case 9, in which there was impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and case 10, in which diabetes was newly diagnosed, the OC and/or EC occurred in patients with longterm hyperglycemia (more than 2 years) or with repeated	
episodes of ketoacidosis (case 2 and case 7). Diabetes is	
considered as a risk factor for EC because of 1) impaired	
immunity and 2) stasis of esophageal contents as a manifestation of neuropathy (1). Although an oral glucose tolerance	
test was not performed in early January 2005 and latent diaDOI: 10.2169/internalmedicine.46.1898

betes was not completely ruled out at that time, the fasting	
plasma glucose level and hemoglobin A1c value in the present case indicated that the duration of clinically overt diabetes was less than three and a half months, a duration that	
was unlikely to have been long enough to have caused	
chronic immune dysfunction or diabetic neuropathy.	
OC in diabetes has recently been reviewed (2), and the	
evidence available is still limited. In several papers to address the correlation between OC and diabetes, we have had	
a deep interest in the hypothesis regarding the interrelationship between diabetes and oral infection that states that diabetes will trigger oral infection, and conversely that oral infection can promote insulin resistance and is also a risk factor for developing diabetes (3). Continuous denture wearing	
has been suggested to be a risk for OC (2), and our patient	
wore dentures almost all the time. We speculate that 1) her	
series of trips may have led to insufficient denture cleaning	
and increased contamination of her dentures, which was	
likely to have promoted Candida growth; 2) the clinical	
Candida infection may have promoted insulin resistance and	
worsened her diabetes; and 3) an increased glucose level in	
her saliva may have further encouraged Candida growth.	
This vicious cycle would contribute to the progression of	
type 2 diabetes and spread of candidiasis. Consistent with	
this speculation, a recent report described the case of an elderly Japanese woman whose only risk factors for OC were	
contaminated dentures and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)	
(4). Dysphagia, especially in our aged patient, would easily	
lead to deterioration of nutritional status and dehydration,	
and that would have further contributed to insulin resistance	
and the spread of the Candida infection, and consequently,	
to extreme hyperglycemia. It was also likely that the patient	
consumed a substantial volume of glucose-containing beverages, which may have increased the glycemia and given rise	
to glucotoxicity, which causes pancreatic beta cell failure	
(5). It is not uncommon for type 2 diabetes to become complicated by ketoacidosis as a result of relative insulin deficiency, an increase in counterregulatory hormones, and severe dehydration (6).	
Biological analyses have revealed mechanisms by which	
hyperglycemia triggers candidiasis specifically to diabetic	
patients; 1) neutrophil dysfunction, 2) impaired opsonization	
because of glucose binding to the third component of complement, and 3) virulence of the pathogens that enables	
them to grow rapidly in the hyperglycemic environment (7).	
Candida albicans, the most frequently detected Candida	
species in oral mucosa specimens from diabetic patients (8,	
9), contains a glucose-inducible protein that inhibits phagocytosis (7). Thus, apart from the neutrophil dysfunction, hyperglycemia itself may be a risk factor for candidiasis. In	
fact, a middle-aged Japanese man who had repeated OC and	
EC was found to have no abnormalities of neutrophil function or lymphocyte proliferation, and it is noteworthy that	
his symptoms were not sufficiently controlled by antifungal	
drugs alone, but only in combination with insulin therapy	
(Table 2 case 6, ref. 10).	
In light of the current review in odontology, however,	
whether or not hyperglycemia is an independent factor for	
OC remains a matter of controversy (2). Recent reports indicate that oral Candida carriage is not directly associated	
with age, denture wearing, gender, or glycemic control (8,	
9). Even though glycemic control is not independently correlated with the Candida carriage, cases reported in Japan	
suggest a relationship between clinically evident OC and	
diabetes (Table 2 and this paper). The accumulation of multiple risk factors including hyperglycemia, denture wearing,	
improper tooth brushing, and aging may trigger OC and EC.	
Many reports suggest that type 2 diabetes is a risk factor	
for periodontal disease (ref.11, for example), and conversely,	
a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of treatment of periodontal disease on glycemic control indicated	
that effective treatment of periodontal infection with doxycycline is associated with a reduction in the HbA1c level	
(12). Also, a Japanese study has indicated that poor glycemic control is associated with poor periodontal status, such	
as increased Candida on the tongue and that the oral microbial flora and salivary function improve after controlling	
fasting glycemia (13). Thus, there is increasing evidence for	
a bidirectional interrelationship between oral health and diabetes. Oral infection is common in the elderly, and poor	
dental health combined with systemic diseases such as diabetes may be associated with increased mortality (14). The	
present patient developed severe hyperglycemia and dehydration, and consequently a life-threatening diabetic complication. An oral hygiene program has shown significant improvement in colonization of the oral mucosa and dentures	
by Candida (15). Greater attention should be paid to oral	
health as a means of preventing serious systemic disease in	
the elderly.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY	
Candida species are the most common cause of fungal	
infections. Candida species produce infections that	
range from non–life-threatening mucocutaneous illnesses to invasive processes that may involve virtually	
any organ. Such a broad range of infections requires	
an equally broad range of diagnostic and therapeutic	
strategies. These guidelines summarize current knowledge about treatment of multiple forms of candidiasis	
for the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).	
Throughout this document, treatment recommendations are rated according to the standard scoring	
scheme used in other IDSA guidelines to illustrate the	
strength of the supporting evidence and quality of the	
underlying data (table 1). This document covers the	
following 4 major topical areas.	
The role of the microbiology laboratory.	
To a	
greater extent than for other fungi, treatment of candidiasis can now be guided by in vitro susceptibility	
testing. However, susceptibility testing of fungi is not	
considered a routine testing procedure in many laboratories, is not always promptly available, and is not	
universally considered as the standard of care. Knowledge of the infecting species, however, is highly predictive of likely susceptibility and can be used as a guide	
to therapy. The guidelines review the available inforReceived 12 September 2003; accepted 12 September 2003; electronically

context. Susceptibility testing is most helpful in dealing	
with deep infection due to non–albicans species of Candida. In this setting, especially if the patient has been	
treated previously with an azole antifungal agent, the

must	
be	
considered.	
Treatment of invasive candidiasis.	
In addition to	
acute hematogenous candidiasis, the guidelines review	
strategies for treatment of 15 other forms of invasive	
candidiasis (table 2). Extensive data from randomized	
trials are available only for therapy of acute hematogenous candidiasis in the nonneutropenic adult. Choice	
of therapy for other forms of candidiasis is based on	
case series and anecdotal reports. In general, amphotericin B–based preparations, the azole antifungal	
agents, and the echinocandin antifungal agents play a	
role in treatment. Choice of therapy is guided by weighing the greater activity of amphotericin B–based preparations and the echinocandin antifungal agents for	
some non–albicans species (e.g., Candida krusei) against	
the ready availability of oral and parenteral formulations for the azole antifungal agents. Flucytosine has	
activity against many isolates of Candida but is infrequently used.	
Treatment of mucocutaneous candidiasis.	
Therapy for mucosal infections is dominated by the azole	
antifungal agents. These drugs may be used topically	
or systemically and are safe and efﬁcacious. A signiﬁcant	
problem with mucosal disease is the propensity for a	
small proportion of patients to have repeated relapses.	
In some situations, the explanation for such a relapse	
is obvious (e.g., recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis in	
an individual with advanced and uncontrolled HIV infection), but in other patients, the cause is cryptic (e.g.,	
relapsing vaginitis in a healthy woman). Rational stratDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/38/2/161/286280 by guest on 14 January 2025

solid-organ transplant (e.g., some liver transplant recipients)	
have a sufﬁcient risk of invasive candidiasis to warrant	
prophylaxis.	
INTRODUCTION	
Relationship between epidemiology of candidal infections	
and therapy.	
Although Candida albicans remains the most	
common pathogen in oropharyngeal and cutaneous candidiasis, non-albicans species of Candida are increasingly associated	
with invasive candidiasis [1–5]. This shift is particularly problematic in patients with acute life-threatening invasive candidal	
infections. Although the susceptibility of Candida to the currently available antifungal agents can be predicted if the species	
of the infecting isolate is known (table 3) [1, 4, 6, 11–17, 20–	
24], individual isolates do not necessarily follow the general	
pattern. For example, C. albicans is usually susceptible to all	
major agents. However, azole resistance for this species is now	
well described among HIV-infected individuals with recurrent	
oropharyngeal candidiasis and is also reported sporadically in	
critically ill adults with invasive candidiasis [25] or in healthy	
adults [26]. For this reason, susceptibility testing for azole resistance is increasingly used to guide the management of candidiasis in patients, especially in situations where there is failure	
to respond to the initial empirical therapy. On the other hand,	
most Candida isolates appear to remain susceptible to amphotericin B, although recent data suggest that isolates of Candida	
glabrata and C. krusei may require maximal doses of amphotericin B (see next section).	
Susceptibility testing and drug dosing.	
Intensive efforts	
to develop standardized, reproducible, and clinically relevant	
susceptibility testing methods for fungi have resulted in the	
development of the NCCLS M27-A methodology (now updated	
with the essentially identical M27-A2 methodology) for susceptibility testing of yeasts [27, 28]. Data-driven interpretive	
breakpoints using this method are available for testing the susceptibility of Candida species to ﬂuconazole, itraconazole, and	
ﬂucytosine [28–31]. Several features of these breakpoints are	
important. First, these interpretive breakpoints should not be	
applied to other methods without extensive testing. Although	
the M27-A2 methodology is not the only possible way to determine an MIC, use of the M27-A2 interpretive breakpoints	
with other methods should be approached with caution—even	
small methodological variations may produce results that are	
not correctly interpreted by means of these breakpoints. Second, these interpretive breakpoints place a strong emphasis on	
interpretation in the context of the delivered dose of the azole	
antifungal agent. The novel category “susceptibility–dose/delivery dependent” (S-DD) indicates that maximization of dosage and bioavailability are critical to successful therapy (table	
4). In the case of ﬂuconazole, data for both human beings and	
animals suggest that S-DD isolates may be treated successfully	
with a dosage of 12 mg/kg per day [30, 32]. Although trials to	
date have not used this method, administration of twice the	
usual daily dose of ﬂuconazole as a loading dose is a pharmacologically rational way to more rapidly achieve higher	
steady-state blood concentrations. In the case of itraconazole,	
oral absorption is somewhat unpredictable, and achievingblood	
levels of 0.5 mg/mL (as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography) appears to be important to successful

Except for amphotericin B, interpretations are based on use of the NCCLS M27-A methodology, and the underlying	
data were drawn from a variety of sources [1, 6–9, 10]. The data for amphotericin B also include results of studies in which	
modiﬁcations of the M27-A methodology have been used to enhance detection of amphotericin B–resistant isolates [6, 11,	
12]. See table 4 for the speciﬁc interpretive breakpoints used to construct this table. I, intermediately resistant; R, resistant;

a Susceptibility methods for the echinocandin antifungal agents (caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin) are not standardized, and interpretive criteria are not available. The 3 drugs show generally similar susceptibility patterns and therefore	
are shown as a class. On the basis of this overall pattern of relative MICs [13–16], isolates of C. parapsilosis and C. guilliermondii	
tend to have numerically higher MICs than do the other species. However, the signiﬁcance of this is entirely unknown at	
present, and clinical responses to invasive disease have been observed with all Candida species for caspofungin [17].	
b On the basis of recent surveys of recent bloodstream isolates [1, 4], 10%–15% of C. glabrata isolates are resistant to	
ﬂuconazole.	
c In addition, 46%–53% of C. glabrata isolates and 31% of C. krusei isolates are resistant to itraconazole.	
d The signiﬁcance of voriconazole MICs has yet to be established. On the basis of recent surveys [18], C. glabrata and C.	
krusei have MICs that are consistently higher than those of the other major species. However, these MICs are generally 1	
mg/mL, these isolates are therefore potentially treatable (on the basis of this compound’s achievable blood levels), and	
successful therapy with isolates of these species has been described [19]. The entry in the table is meant to describe this	
current lack of information.	
e On the basis of a combination of in vitro data [4, 11, 20] and in vivo data [21, 22], it appears that a signiﬁcant proportion	
of the isolates of C. glabrata and C. krusei have reduced susceptibility to amphotericin B.	
f Although not seen in all isolates, amphotericin B resistance is well described for isolates of this species [23, 24].	
trapolation of these results to other diagnostic settings appears	
to be rational on the basis of data from in vivo therapy models,	
it is still prudent to consider the limitations of the data when	
making use of the breakpoints. Pharmacology, safety, published	
reports, drug interactions, and isolate susceptibility [27] must	
be considered when selecting a therapy. For example, most	
isolates of Candida are susceptible to itraconazole, but this	
agent only recently became available as a parenteral preparation	
and has not been studied intensively for candidiasis, except for	
treatment of mucosal disease.	
Reliable and convincing interpretive breakpoints are not yet	
available for amphotericin B. The NCCLS M27-A2 methodology does not reliably identify amphotericin B–resistant isolates [6]. Variations of the M27-A2 methodology using different	
media [6], agar-based MIC methods [12, 35, 36], and measurements of minimum fungicidal concentrations [11] appear	
to enhance detection of resistant isolates. Although these methods are as yet insufﬁciently standardized to permit routine use,	
several generalizations are becoming apparent. First, amphotericin B resistance appears uncommon among isolates of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. Second,	
isolates of Candida lusitaniae most often demonstrate readily	
detectable and clinically apparent amphotericin B resistance.	
Not all isolates are resistant [11, 23, 37], but therapeutic failure	
of amphotericin B is well documented [38]. Third, a growing	
body of data suggests that a nontrivial proportion of the isolates	
of C. glabrata and C. krusei may be resistant to amphotericin	
B [4, 11, 20–22]. Of importance, delivery of additional amphotericin B by use of a lipid-based preparation of amphotericin B may be inadequate to overcome this resistance [22]. Also,	
because of in vitro effects of the lipid, tests for susceptibility	
to amphotericin B should always use the deoxycholate rather	
than the lipid formulation [39]. Unfortunately, the clinical relevance of these observations is uncertain. Most rational current	
therapy of infections due to these species (C. lusitaniae, C.	
glabrata, and C. krusei) thus involves (1) awareness of the possibility of true microbiological resistance among the species and	
(2) judicious and cautious use of susceptibility testing. When	
amphotericin B deoxycholate is used to treat infections due to	
C. glabrata or C. krusei, doses of at least 1 mg/kg per day may	
be needed, especially in profoundly immunocompromised	
hosts.	
Meaningful data do not yet exist for other compounds. This	
includes speciﬁcally the newer expanded-spectrum triazoles	
(voriconazole, posaconazole, and ravuconazole) and the echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin). Although MIC data for these compounds are available for all	
major Candida species (table 3), the interpretation of those	
MICs in relation to achievable blood levels is uncertain [29].	
This is particularly true for the echinocandin antifungal agents.

a standard of care and is not widely available, and results of	
testing may not be available for days. The strongest data to	
date are for ﬂuconazole, an agent for which the issues of resistance are most compelling. The greatest concern for ﬂuconazole resistance relates to C. glabrata, for which rates of resistance as high as 15% have been reported [40]. Testing is most	
often used in 1 of 2 ways [27]. First, susceptibility is useful in	
the evaluation of the possible causes of lack of clinical response.	
Second, the data may be used to support a change in therapy	
from a parenteral agent of any class to oral ﬂuconazole. This	
consideration is most relevant when considering outpatient	
therapy and for treating infections that require protracted therapy (e.g., meningitis, endocarditis, and osteomyelitis).	
AVAILABLE DRUGS AND DRUG USE	
The rapid pace of antifungal drug development has resulted in	
the recent licensure of 2 new antifungal drugs (voriconazole	
and caspofungin), along with the active development of 4 others	
(ravuconazole, posaconazole, micafungin, and anidulafungin).	
In addition, new data continue to accumulate for itraconazole	
and the lipid-associated preparations of amphotericin B. Although all these compounds appear to have signiﬁcant activity	
against Candida species, the size of the published clinical database for these compounds for treatment of candidiasis is limited. In an effort to integrate these agents into the guidelines,	
the available data on the newly licensed agents will be summarized here.	
Itraconazole.	
An intravenous preparation of itraconazole	
in hydroxy-propyl-b-cyclodextrin has been licensed. This formulation is administered at a dosage of 200 mg q12h for a	
total of 4 doses (i.e., 2 days) followed by 200 mg/day and was	
licensed on the basis of evidence that this dosing regimen	
achieves adequate blood levels more rapidly and with less patient-to-patient variability than do oral preparations of the drug	
[41–44]. Itraconazole is well known to be active against mucosal	
forms of candidiasis (see Nongenital Mucocutaneous Candidiasis, below), but the availability of an intravenous form of	
itraconazole allows for treatment of invasive disease. Although	
itraconazole would be expected to have activity broadly similar	
to that of ﬂuconazole, the 2 compounds have quite different	
pharmacological properties and clinical activities for other mycoses [45]. Moreover, formal studies of intravenous itraconazole for invasive candidiasis are not available. Therefore, the	
discussion of therapy for invasive candidiasis will generally not	
address intravenous itraconazole.	
Voriconazole and the newer azole antifungal agents.	
Voriconazole is available in both oral and parenteral preparations.	
It is as active as ﬂuconazole against esophageal candidiasis,	
although it was associated with more adverse events in a recent	
study [46]. Among 4 pediatric patients who received voriconazole as salvage therapy, candidemia cleared in 2 of 2 patients	
and disseminated candidiasis resolved in 1 of 2 patients [47].	
It is notable that voriconazole appears to have the potential to	
be active against some ﬂuconazole-resistant isolates. Of 12 HIVinfected subjects with ﬂuconazole-refractory esophageal candidiasis due to C. albicans, 7 were cured and the conditions of	
3 improved because of treatment with voriconazole [48]. Consistent with its activity against C. krusei in a guinea pig model	
[49], recent experience from open-label protocols reported response in 7 (70%) of 10 patients with invasive disease due to	
this species [19]. On the basis of these data, voriconazole received an indication in the European Union for “treatment of	
ﬂuconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei).” Voriconazole is not currently licensed for	
this indication in the United States, awaiting an analysis of a	
recently	
completed	
worldwide	
study	
of	
its	
activity	
in	
candidemia.	
The in vitro anti-Candida activity of the other azoles under	
active development (posaconazole and ravuconazole) also appears to be good [50]. The available clinical data for posaconazole include reports of successful salvage therapy for invasive	
candidiasis [51], successful salvage therapy of azole-refractory	
oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV-infected individuals [52], and	
2 randomized comparisons showing efﬁcacy comparable with	
that of ﬂuconazole for non–azole-refractory esophageal candidiasis [53, 54]. The available data for ravuconazole include	
a randomized phase II dose-ranging study showing efﬁcacy	
comparable with that of ﬂuconazole for non–azole-refractory	
esophageal candidiasis [55].	
Caspofungin and the echinocandin antifungal agents.	
Caspofungin is the ﬁrst of the echinocandin antifungal agents	
to be licensed. As with all of the agents of this class, this agent	
is only available as a parenteral preparation, and its spectrum	
is largely limited to Candida and Aspergillus species. Of particular relevance for use as empirical treatment, the agents of	
this class do not appear to have signiﬁcant activity against	
Cryptococcus neoformans or against ﬁlamentous fungi other	
than Aspergillus [56].

Caspofungin has been shown to be as effective as both amphotericin B deoxycholate and ﬂuconazole when used as therapy for oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis [57–60].	
Likewise, Mora-Duarte et al. [17] found that caspofungin (70mg loading dose followed by 50 mg/day in adults) was equivalent to but better tolerated than was amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.6–1.0 mg/kg per day) for cases of invasive candidiasis	
(83% of which were candidemia, 10% of which were peritonitis,	
and 7% of which were miscellaneous cases). Finally, caspofungin was effective in 72% of patients with ﬂuconazole-resistant	
esophageal candidiasis [61]. This agent appears to be active	
against all Candida species; however, the MICs for some isolates	
of C. parapsilosis and Candida guilliermondii are relatively	
higher. The meaning of these higher MICs is still being investigated, but the data from the aforementioned study by MoraDuarte et al. [17] hint at their possible clinical relevance [62].	
Although C. parapsilosis caused only 19% of cases of fungemia	
in the caspofungin-treated group in that study, it was associated	
with 42% cases of persistent fungemia. Conversely, the species	
distribution of cases of persistent fungemia for amphotericin	
B–treated patients more closely paralleled the distribution of	
infecting species. It must be emphasized, however, that the total	
number of cases is very small and that the overall success rates	
for treatment of infections due to C. parapsilosis were similar	
between the study arms. Thus, these data suggest that echinocandins may be used successfully for treatment of C. parapsilosis fungemia but that the physician should be aware of the	
possibility that this species might respond less readily to this	
class of agents.	
The in vitro activity of the other 2 agents in this category	
(anidulafungin and micafungin) against Candida species appears quite similar to that of caspofungin, and clinical data are	
expected to support similar patterns of utility. However, available clinical data for these agents are as yet limited to openlabel dose-ranging studies of micafungin for treatment of	
esophageal candidiasis [63–65], open-label studies of anidulafungin for esophageal candidiasis [66], open-label data on	
micafungin administered to patients with candidemia [67, 68],	
and a randomized, double-blind comparison of micafungin	
with ﬂuconazole as prophylaxis during the period of risk for	
neutropenia following bone marrow transplantation [69].	
Amphotericin B deoxycholate and the lipid-associated formulations of amphotericin B.	
The majority of the experience	
with amphotericin B is with its classic deoxycholate preparation. However, 3 lipid-associated formulations of amphotericin	
B have been developed and approved for use in humans: amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) (Abelcet; Enzon), amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCD) (Amphotec [in the	
United States] and Amphocil [elsewhere]; InterMune), and liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome; Vestar). The names of	
these compounds, along with the requirement for use of the	
lipid-associated formulations at much higher doses than the	
deoxycholate preparation, have led to much confusion. The	
reader should note carefully that (1) “liposomal amphotericin	
B” is the name of a speciﬁc lipid-associated product, (2) a useful	
general term for the class is “lipid-associated formulations of	
amphotericin B,” (3) the 3 lipid-associated formulations of	
amphotericin B have different pharmacological properties and	
rates of treatment-related adverse events and thus should not	
be interchanged without careful consideration, (4) the typical	
intravenous dose for amphotericin B deoxycholate is 0.6–1.0	
mg/kg per day, and (e) the typical dosage for the lipid-associated formulations when used for candidiasis is 3–5 mg/kg per	
day.	
In this document, a reference to “intravenous amphotericin	
B” without a speciﬁc dose or other discussion of form should	
be taken to be a reference to the general use of any of the	
preparations of amphotericin B, with the understanding that	
the clinical experience is greatest with amphotericin B deoxycholate for essentially all forms of candidiasis and classes of	
patients. On the other hand, references to a speciﬁc formulation	
and dosage indicate more-speciﬁc data. We are not aware of	
any forms of candidiasis for which a lipid-associated formulation of amphotericin B is superior to amphotericin B deoxycholate [70], but we are also not aware of any situations in	
which a lipid-associated formulation would be contraindicated.	
The only possible exception is urinary candidiasis in which the	
protection of the kidney afforded by the altered pharmacological properties of the lipid-associated preparations of amphotericin B [71] has the theoretical potential to reduce delivery	
of amphotericin B and thus slow the pace of response [72].	
The relative paucity of organized clinical data does, however,	
produce uncertainty regarding the optimal dose and duration	
of therapy with these agents.	
Only ABLC and liposomal amphotericin B have been approved for use in proven cases of candidiasis. These approvals	
are for second-line therapy for patients who are intolerant of	
or have an infection refractory to therapy with conventional	
amphotericin B deoxycholate; these circumstances were deﬁned	
in one study in which ABLC was administered as failure of	
therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate (500 mg), initial	
renal insufﬁciency (creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL or creatinine	
clearance of !25 mL/min), a signiﬁcant increase in creatinine	
level (up to 2.5 mg/dL in adults or 1.5 mg/dL in children [73]),	
or severe, acute, administration-related toxicity. Patients with	
invasive candidiasis also have been treated successfully with	
ABCD [74, 75]. Both in vivo and clinical studies indicate that	
these compounds are less toxic but as effective as amphotericin	
B deoxycholate when used in appropriate dosages [76, 77].	
Nevertheless, their higher cost and the paucity of randomized	
trials of their efﬁcacy against proven invasive candidiasis limit	
their front-line use for treatment of these infections. These

agents dramatically alter the pharmacology of amphotericin B,	
and the full implications of these changes are not yet known	
[78, 79].	
Although amphotericin B deoxycholate has long been the	
standard agent for treatment of invasive candidiasis, the toxicity	
of this preparation is increasingly appreciated. Lipid-associated	
preparations have previously been considered primarily for patients who are intolerant of or have an infection refractory to	
the deoxycholate preparation. However, data showing that amphotericin B–induced nephrotoxicity may be associated with	
an up to 6.6-fold increase in mortality [80] makes consideration	
of initial use of lipid-associated amphotericin B appropriate for	
individuals who are at high risk of being intolerant of amphotericin B deoxycholate (e.g., those who require prolonged therapy; have preexisting renal dysfunction; or require continued	
concomitant use of another nephrotoxic agent, such as cisplatinum, an aminoglycoside, or cyclosporine [81, 82]). Some	
authors have also suggested that residence in an intensive care	
unit (ICU) or an intermediate care unit at the time of initiation	
of amphotericin B deoxycholate therapy is an additional risk	
factor for renal failure [82]. Additional work is required to help	
identify those individuals who can safely tolerate the deoxycholate preparation. The lipid-associated agents are licensed to	
be administered at the following dosages: ABLC, 5 mg/kg per	
day; ABCD, 3–6 mg/kg per day; and liposomal amphotericin	
B, 3–5 mg/kg per day. The optimal dosages of these compounds	
for serious Candida infections is unclear, and the agents appear	
generally equipotent. Dosages of 3–5 mg/kg would appear suitable for treatment of most serious candidal infections [83, 84].	
Appropriate dosages in pediatric patients.	
The topic of	
the pharmacological properties of antifungal agents in children	
and infants has been reviewed in detail [85]. Data on dosing	
for the antifungal agents in pediatric patients are limited. Amphotericin B deoxycholate appears to have similar kinetics in	
neonates and adults [86]. A phase I and II study of ABLC (2–	
5 mg/kg per day) in the treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis	
in children found that the area under the curve and the maximal	
concentration of drug were similar to those of adults and that	
steady-state concentration appeared to be achieved after ∼7	
days of therapy [83]. Anecdotal data suggest that liposomal	
amphotericin B can be used in neonates [87]. Because clearance	
of ﬂucytosine is directly proportional to glomerular ﬁltration	
rate, infants with very low birth weight may accumulate high	
plasma concentrations because of immature renal function	
[88].	
The pharmacokinetics of ﬂuconazole vary with age [89–92].	
Because of its more rapid clearance in children (plasma halflife, ∼14 h) [89], ﬂuconazole at a dosage of 6 mg/kg q12h	
should be administered for treatment of life-threatening infections. In comparison with the volume of distribution seen in	
adults (0.7 L/kg), neonates may have a 2–3-fold higher volume	
of distribution that falls to !1 L/kg by 3 months of age. In	
comparison with the half-life of ﬂuconazole in adults (30 h),	
the half-life in neonates is 55–90 h [93]. Despite this prolonged	
half-life, once-daily dosing seems prudent in infants with low	
or very low birth weight who are being treated for disseminated	
candidiasis. A dosage of 5 mg/kg per day has been used safely	
and successfully in this population [94].	
Itraconazole cyclodextrin oral solution (5 mg/kg per day)	
administered to infants and children was found to provide	
potentially therapeutic concentrations in plasma [95]. The levels were, however, substantially lower than those attained in	
adult patients with cancer, particularly in children aged between	
6 months and 2 years. A recent study of itraconazole cyclodextrin oral solution (2.5 mg/kg per day and 5 mg/kg per day)	
in HIV-infected children documented its efﬁcacy for treating	
oropharyngeal candidiasis in pediatric patients [96]. The newly	
licensed intravenous formulation of itraconazole has not been	
studied in pediatric patients.	
The published data on the use of the echinocandins in pediatric or neonatal patients includes small numbers of patients	
treated with caspofungin and micafungin [97–99]. The data	
suggest safety and efﬁcacy in such patients.	
TREATMENT GUIDELINES OVERVIEW	
These practice guidelines provide recommendations for treatment of various forms of candidiasis. For each form, we specify	
objectives; treatment options; outcomes of treatment; evidence;	
values; beneﬁts, harms, and costs; and key recommendations.	
Please see the discussion above with regard to available therapeutic agents: the amount of data on the newest agents (caspofungin and voriconazole) is quite limited, and they will be	
mentioned below only in reference to selected presentations of	
candidiasis.	
CANDIDEMIA AND ACUTE HEMATOGENOUSLY	
DISSEMINATED CANDIDIASIS	
Objective.	
To resolve signs and symptoms of associated	
sepsis, to sterilize the bloodstream and any clinically evident	
sites of hematogenous dissemination, and to treat occult sites	
of hematogenous dissemination.	
Treatment options.	
Intravenous amphotericin B, intravenous or oral ﬂuconazole, intravenous caspofungin, or the	
combination of ﬂuconazole plus amphotericin B (with the amphotericin B administered for the ﬁrst 5–6 days only). Flucytosine could be considered in combination with amphotericin	
B for more-severe infections (C-III; see table 1 and Sobel [100]	
for deﬁnitions of categories reﬂecting the strength of each recommendation for or against its use and grades reﬂecting the	
quality of evidence on which recommendations are based). ReDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/38/2/161/286280 by guest on 14 January 2025

moval of existing intravascular catheters is desirable, if feasible,	
especially in nonneutropenic patients (B-II).	
Outcomes.	
Clearance of bloodstream and other clinically	
evident sites of infection, symptomatic improvement, absence	
of retinal ﬁndings of Candida endophthalmitis, and adequate	
follow-up to ensure that late-appearing symptoms of focal hematogenous spread are not overlooked.	
Evidence.	
Candida bloodstream infections are increasingly	
frequent [101, 102] and are often associated with clinical evidence of sepsis syndrome and high associated attributable mortality [103, 104]. In addition, hematogenous seeding may compromise the function of 1 organ. Two large randomized	
studies [105, 106] and 2 large observational studies [107, 108]	
have demonstrated that ﬂuconazole (400 mg/day) and amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.5–0.6 mg/kg per day) are similarly	
effective as therapy. A large randomized study has demonstrated	
that caspofungin (70 mg on the ﬁrst day followed by 50 mg/	
day) is equivalent to amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.6–1.0 mg/	
kg per day) for invasive candidiasis (mostly candidemia) [17].	
Caspofungin was better tolerated and had a superior response	
rate in a predeﬁned secondary analysis of evaluable patients. A	
comparison of ﬂuconazole (800 mg/day) with the combination	
of ﬂuconazole (800 mg/day) plus amphotericin B deoxycholate	
(∼0.7 mg/kd per day for the ﬁrst 5–6 days) as therapy for	
candidemia was confounded by differences in severity of illness	
between the study groups, but the study found the regimens	
to be comparable and noted a trend toward better response	
(based principally on more-effective bloodstream clearance) in	
the group receiving combination therapy. The randomized	
studies are largely limited to nonneutropenic patients, whereas	
the observational studies provide data suggesting that ﬂuconazole and amphotericin B are similarly effective in neutropenic	
patients. ABLC and liposomal amphotericin B are indicated for	
patients intolerant of or with infection refractory to conventional antifungal therapy. Open-label therapy of candidemia	
with ABCD (2–6 mg/kg per day) has been successful [75]. In	
a randomized trial, ABLC (5 mg/kg per day) was found to be	
equivalent to amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.6–1.0 mg/kg per	
day) as therapy for nosocomial candidiasis [109].	
Values.	
Without adequate therapy, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, and other severe disseminated forms of candidiasis	
may complicate candidemia. Given the potential severity of the	
clinical syndrome, it is important that the initial empirical	
choice be adequate to address the most likely species and their	
associated susceptibility to the various agents. Candidemia due	
to C. parapsilosis has increased in frequency in pediatric populations and appears to be associated with a lower mortality	
rate than is candidemia due to other species of Candida [110–	
113]. Candidemia due to C. glabrata may be associated with	
increased mortality in patients with cancer [113]. In neonates,	
a duration of candidemia of 5 days has been linked to the	
likelihood of ophthalmologic, renal, and cardiac involvement	
[114].	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Effective therapy is potentially	
lifesaving. Amphotericin B–induced nephrotoxicity can complicate management of critically ill patients.	
Key recommendations.	
If feasible, initial nonmedicalmanagement should include removal of all existing central venous	
catheters (B-II). The evidence for this recommendation is	
strongest for the nonneutropenic patient population [108, 115,	
116] and includes data in which catheter removal was associated	
with reduced mortality in adults [108, 116] and neonates [117].	
In neutropenic patients, the role of the gut as a source for	
disseminated candidiasis is evident from autopsy studies, but,	
in an individual patient, it is difﬁcult to determine the relative	
contributions of the gut and a catheter as primary sources of	
fungemia [107, 108, 118]. An exception is made for fungemia	
due to C. parapsilosis, which is very frequently associated with	
use of catheters (A-II) [107]. There are, however, no randomized studies of this topic, and a recent exhaustive review [119]	
clearly demonstrates the limitations of the available data. However, the consensus opinion is that existing central venous catheters should be removed, when feasible [120]. Anecdotal reports	
of successful in situ treatment of infected catheters by instillation of antibiotic lock solutions containing as much as 2.5	
mg/mL of amphotericin B deoxycholate [121–125] suggest this	
as an option in selected cases, but the required duration of	
therapy and the frequency of relapse are not known.	
Initial medical therapy should involve caspofungin, ﬂuconazole, an amphotericin B preparation, or combination therapy	
with ﬂuconazole plus amphotericin B. The choice between these	
treatments depends on the clinical status of the patient, the	
physician’s knowledge of the species and/or antifungal susceptibility of the infecting isolate, the relative drug toxicity, the	
presence of organ dysfunction that would affect drug clearance,	
available knowledge of use of the drug in the given patient	
population, and the patient’s prior exposure to antifungal	
agents. Experience with caspofungin (a 70-mg loading dose	
followed by 50 mg daily) is, as yet, limited, but its excellent	
clinical activity [17], its broad-spectrum activity against Candida species, and a low rate of treatment-related adverse events	
make it a suitable choice for initial therapy in adults (A-I). For	
clinically stable patients who have not recently received azole	
therapy, ﬂuconazole (6 mg/kg per day; i.e., 400 mg/day for	
a 70-kg patient) is another appropriate choice (A-I) [126, 127].	
For clinically unstable patients infected with an unspeciated	
isolate, ﬂuconazole has been used successfully, but many authorities prefer amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg per	
day) [126, 127] because of its broader spectrum. If a lipidassociated formulation of amphotericin B is selected, a dosage	
of at least 3 mg/kg/d appears suitable (C-III). A combination	
of ﬂuconazole (800 mg/day) plus amphotericin B deoxycholDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/38/2/161/286280 by guest on 14 January 2025	
Guidelines for Treatment of Candidiasis • CID 2004:38 (15 January) • 169	
ate (0.7 mg/kg per day for the ﬁrst 5–6 days) is also suitable	
(A-I).	
Neonates with disseminated candidiasis are usually treated	
with amphotericin B deoxycholate because of its low toxicity	
and because of the relative lack of experience with other agents	
in this population. Fluconazole (6–12 mg/kg per day) has been	
used successfully in small numbers of neonates [128–131].	
There are currently no data on the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin in neonates.	
Antifungal susceptibility can be broadly predicted once the	
isolate has been identiﬁed to the species level (see the subsection	
Susceptibility testing and drug dosing, in the Introduction).	
Infections with C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis may	
be treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.6 mg/kg per	
day), ﬂuconazole (6 mg/kg per day), or caspofungin (70-mg	
loading dose followed by 50 mg/day) (A-I). Because C. glabrata	
often has reduced susceptibility to both azoles and amphotericin B, opinions on the best therapy are divided [127]. Both	
C. krusei and C. glabrata appear susceptible to caspofungin,	
and this agent appears to be a good alternative (A-I). Although	
fungemia due to C. glabrata has been treated successfully with	
ﬂuconazole (6 mg/kg per day) [105, 132], many authorities	
prefer amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg per day) (BIII) [127]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic predictions [133],	
ﬂuconazole (12 mg/kg per day; 800 mg/day for a 70-kg patient)	
may be a suitable alternative, particularly in less-critically ill	
patients (C-III). If the infecting isolate is known or likely to	
be C. krusei, available data suggest that amphotericin B deoxycholate (1.0 mg/kg per day) is preferred (C-III). On the basis	
of data on open-label salvage therapy, voriconazole is licensed	
in Europe (but not the United States) for “treatment of ﬂuconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei)” [19] and could be considered as an alternative	
choice (B-III). Many, but not all, isolates of C. lusitaniae are	
resistant to amphotericin B. Therefore, ﬂuconazole (6 mg/kg	
per day) is the preferred therapy for this species (B-III). Both	
voriconazole and caspofungin would be expected to be active	
against this species (C-III). Issues associated with selection and	
dosage of the lipid amphotericin preparations are discussed in	
the Introduction. As discussed above and elsewhere, susceptibility testing may be used to identify isolates that are less likely	
to respond to ﬂuconazole (A-II) or amphotericin B (B-II) (table	
3) [27, 30].	
For candidemia, therapy should be continued for 2 weeks	
after the last positive blood culture result and resolution of	
signs and symptoms of infection (A-III). Amphotericin B or	
caspofungin may be switched to ﬂuconazole (intravenous or	
oral) for completion of therapy (B-III). Patients who are neutropenic at the time of developing candidemia should receive	
a recombinant cytokine that accelerates recovery from neutropenia (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocytemonocyte colony-stimulating factor) [134]. Other forms of immunosuppression should be modiﬁed, when possible (e.g., by	
reduction of a corticosteroid dosage).	
Breakthrough (or persistence of) candidemia in the face of	
ongoing antifungal therapy suggests the possibility of an infected intravascular device [135], signiﬁcant immunosuppression [136], or microbiological resistance. Therapy with an agent	
from a different class should be started, the isolate should be	
promptly identiﬁed to the species level, and susceptibility testing should be considered. Infected intravascular devices should	
be removed, when feasible, and immunosuppression should be	
ameliorated.	
Finally, all patients with candidemia should undergo at least	
1 ophthalmological examination to exclude the possibility of	
candidal endophthalmitis (A-II). Although some authors have	
suggested that examinations should be conducted for 2 weeks	
after negative ﬁndings of an initial examination [137], these	
recommendations are based on small numbers of patients. The	
results of large prospective therapy studies that included careful	
ophthalmological examinations suggest that onset of retinal	
lesions is rare following an otherwise apparently successful	
course of systemic therapy (there were no such cases in 441	
successfully treated subjects [17, 105, 132]. We thus conclude	
that candidemic individuals should have at least 1 careful ophthalmological examination, preferably at a time when the candidemia appears controlled and new spread to the eye is unlikely	
(B-III). These data and recommendations are based almost	
entirely on experience in the treatment of nonneutropenic patients—neutropenic patients may not manifest visible endophthalmitis until recovery from neutropenia, and, therefore,	
ophthalmological examination should be performed after recovery of the neutrophil count.	
EMPIRICAL TREATMENT OF SUSPECTED

with

Evidence.	
Although Candida is now the fourth most common bloodstream isolate and is the most common invasive	
fungal infection in critically ill nonneutropenic patients, accurate early diagnostic tools for invasive candidiasis are lacking.

prolonged use of antibacterial antibiotics, presence of central	
venous catheters, hyperalimentation, surgery (especiallysurgery	
that transects the gut wall), and prolonged ICU stay have all	
been linked to increased risk of invasive candidiasis [139–141].	
Although empirical therapy is intuitively attractive, colonization does not always imply infection [142], and compelling	
data that deﬁne appropriate subsets of patients for such therapy	
are lacking.	
Values.	
Prevention of clinically evident invasivecandidiasis	
could potentially reduce morbidity and mortality.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Given the ill-deﬁned nature	
of this syndrome, preference is often given to therapies with	
lesser toxicity. Widespread use of inappropriate antifungal therapy may have deleterious epidemiological consequences, including selection of resistant organisms.	
Key recommendations.	
The utility of antifungal therapy	
for this syndrome has not been deﬁned. If therapy is given, its	
use should be limited to patients with (1) Candida species	
colonization (preferably at multiple sites [139, 143]), (2) multiple other risk factors, and (3) absence of any other uncorrected	
causes of fever (C-III) [127]. The absence of colonization by	
Candida species indicates a lower risk for invasive candidiasis	
and warrants delaying empirical therapy.	
EMPIRICAL ANTIFUNGAL TREATMENT OF	
NEUTROPENIC PATIENTS WITH PROLONGED	
FEVER DESPITE ANTIBACTERIAL THERAPY	
Objective.	
To treat early occult fungal infection and prevent fungal infection in high-risk patients.	
Treatment options.	
Empirical therapy should address both	
yeast and mould infections. Until recently, amphotericin B was	
the only sufﬁciently broad-spectrum agent available in a reliable	
parenteral form. Itraconazole has an adequate antifungal spectrum of activity and has been shown to have activity equivalent	
to that of amphotericin B [144]. If itraconazole is used, initiation of therapy with the intravenous formulation is appropriate, because the bioavailability of the current oral formulations of itraconazole (including the cyclodextrin solution) is	
unpredictable [145, 146]. Fluconazole may be inappropriate	
because of prior exposure and its limited spectrum. Voriconazole has been shown to be active in high-risk patients (e.g.,	
allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients and individuals	
with relapsed leukemia) for prevention of breakthrough fungal	
infections [147]. The role of caspofungin and the other echinocandin antifungal agents in the treatment of such patients is	
uncertain.	
Outcomes.	
Resolution of fever and prevention of development of clinically overt infection.	
Evidence.	
This clinical condition has recently been reviewed, and there is a related guideline from the IDSA [134].	
Randomized, prospective clinical trials have demonstrated that	
neutropenic patients with persistent fever despite receipt of	
broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy have an ∼20% risk of	
developing an overt invasive fungal infection [148, 149]. Empirical antifungal therapy reduces the frequency of development	
of clinically overt invasive fungal infection in this high-risk	
population [148–150].	
Values.	
Early antifungal therapy is more likely to succeed	
in neutropenic patients. Advanced infection is associated with	
high morbidity and mortality.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Early treatment of fungal infections should reduce fungal infection–associated morbidity.	
Key recommendations.	
Antifungal therapy is appropriate	
in neutropenic patients who have persistent unexplained fever,	
despite receipt of 4–7 days of appropriate antibacterial therapy.	
Once begun, therapy is continued until resolution of neutropenia. Amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.5–0.7 mg/kg per day)	
has traditionally been the preferred agent (A-II). When compared with amphotericin B deoxycholate (median dose, 0.6 mg/	
kg per day), liposomal amphotericin B (median dose, 3 mg/kg	
per day) showed similar overall clinical efﬁcacy but demonstrated superior safety and a decreased rate of documented	
breakthrough fungal infections, particularly in recipients of	
bone marrow transplants (A-I) [151]. When compared with	
amphotericin B deoxycholate (mean daily dose, 0.7 mg/kg),	
itraconazole (200 mg iv q12h for 2 days, 200 mg iv per day	
for 12 days, and then 400-mg solution po per day) showed	
similar breakthrough fungal infection rates and mortality but	
signiﬁcantly less toxicity (A-I) [144]. Although the data are	
controversial because some analyses show that voriconazole	
was, overall, slightly inferior to liposomal amphotericin B [147,	
152–155], voriconazole has been shown to be superior to liposomal amphotericin B in the prevention of breakthrough	
fungal infections in high-risk patients (A-I). Thus, use of this	
compound should be limited to allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients and individuals with relapsed leukemia. Fluconazole (400 mg/day) has been used successfully for selected	
patients (A-I) [156–158] and could be considered as an alternative strategy [127] if (1) the patient is at low risk for invasive	
aspergillosis, (2) the patient lacks any other signs or symptoms	
suggesting aspergillosis, (3) local epidemiologic data suggest	
that the patient is at low risk for infection with azole-resistant	
isolates of Candida, and (4) the patient has not received an	
azole antifungal agent as prophylaxis.	
CHRONIC DISSEMINATED CANDIDIASIS	
(HEPATOSPLENIC CANDIDIASIS)	
Objective.	
To eradicate foci of chronic disseminated	
candidiasis.	
Treatment options.	
Intravenous amphotericin B or intraDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/38/2/161/286280 by guest on 14 January 2025	
Guidelines for Treatment of Candidiasis • CID 2004:38 (15 January) • 171	
venous or oral ﬂuconazole. Flucytosine in combination with	
one of these agents could be considered for more-refractory	
infections.	
Outcomes.	
Resolution of clinical signs and symptoms of	
infection and resolution of radiographic ﬁndings of visceral	
involvement.	
Evidence. Open-label and observational studies have evaluated the utility of amphotericin B deoxycholate [159, 160],	
lipid-associated amphotericin B [83], and ﬂuconazole [161,	
162]. A recent case report suggests that caspofungin might have	
activity against this form of candidiasis [163].	
Values.	
This syndrome is not acutely life-threatening but	
does require prolonged therapy to produce a cure. Thus, importance is placed on use of a convenient and nontoxic longterm regimen.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Amphotericin B, although efﬁcacious, must be administered intravenously. Fluconazole can	
be given orally.	
Key recommendations.	
Fluconazole (6 mg/kg per day) is	
generally preferred for clinically stable patients (B-III). Amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.6–0.7 mg/kg per day) or a lipidassociated formulation of amphotericin B (3–5 mg/kg per day)	
may be used in acutely ill patients or patients with refractory	
disease. Some experts recommend an initial 1–2-week course	
of amphotericin B for all patients, followed by a prolonged	
course of ﬂuconazole [126]. Therapy should be continued until	
calciﬁcation or resolution of lesions, particularly in patients	
receiving continued chemotherapy or immunosuppression.	
Premature discontinuation of antifungal therapy may lead to	
recurrent infection. Patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis may continue to receive chemotherapy, including ablative therapy for recipients of bone marrow and/or stem cell	
transplants. Treatment of chronic disseminated candidiasis in	
such patients continues throughout chemotherapy [160].	
DISSEMINATED CUTANEOUS NEONATAL	
CANDIDIASIS	
Objective.	
To treat infants with disseminated cutaneous	
neonatal candidiasis (also known as congenital candidiasis)who	
are at high risk for developing acute disseminated candidiasis.	
Treatment options.	
In healthy infants with normal birth	
weight, treatment of primary cutaneous candidiasis with topical	
agents is generally appropriate. In patients at risk for acute	
bloodstream or visceral dissemination, therapies used for acute	
disseminated candidiasis are appropriate.	
Outcomes.	
The neonatal candidiasis syndrome is a unique	
syndrome in which widespread dermatitis due to Candida infection is seen in neonates. This syndrome is thought to be	
secondary to contamination of the amniotic ﬂuid, and, in	
healthy-term infants, this process is usually limited to the skin	
and resolves with topical therapy [164]. However, neonates	
born prematurely or infants with low birth weight and prolonged rupture of cutaneous membranes, the cutaneous process	
may become invasive and produce acute disseminated candidiasis [165].	
Evidence.	
Essentially all data are derived from small case	
series and individual reports. Most reports have been limited	
to use of amphotericin B.	
Values.	
If not treated, acute disseminated candidiasis may	
develop, which can be lethal.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Amphotericin B deoxycholate	
therapy is generally well tolerated in neonates. Fluconazole has	
not been as well studied. In particular, the pharmacological	
properties of ﬂuconazole vary with neonatal age, making the	
choice of dosage somewhat difﬁcult [86, 90, 91].	
Key recommendations.	
Prematurely born neonates, neonates with low birth weight, or infants with prolonged rupture	
of membranes who demonstrate the clinical ﬁndings associated	
with disseminated neonatal cutaneous candidiasis should be	
considered for systemic therapy. Amphotericin B deoxycholate	
(0.5–1 mg/kg per day, for a total dose of 10–25 mg/kg) is	
generally used (B-III). Fluconazole may be used as a secondline agent (B-III). Dosing issues for neonates are discussed in	
the subsection Appropriate dosages for pediatric patients, in	
the section Available Drugs and Drug Use (above).	
URINARY CANDIDIASIS	
Objective.	
To eradicate signs and symptoms associated	
with parenchymal infection of the urinary collecting system. In	
select patients, such therapy might reduce the risk of ascending	
or disseminated infection.	
Treatment options.	
Fluconazole (oral or intravenous),amphotericin B (intravenous), or ﬂucytosine (oral). Because of	
bladder irrigation, amphotericin B fails to treat disease above	
the level of the bladder.	
Outcome.	
Clearance of infection in urine.	
Evidence.	
Urinary candidiasis includes an ill-deﬁned	
group of syndromes [166]. The most common risk factors for	
candiduria include urinary tract instrumentation, recent receipt	
of antibiotic therapy, and advanced age [167]. Candida species	
are now the organisms most frequently isolated from the urine	
of patients in surgical ICUs. In most patients, isolation of Candida species represents only colonization as a benign event. In	
individuals with candidemia, Foley catheter change alone rarely	
results in clearance of candiduria (!20%). However, discontinuation of catheter use alone may result in eradication of candiduria in almost 40% of patients [168] (B-III). A recently	
completed placebo-controlled trial found that ﬂuconazole (200	
mg/day for 14 days) hastened the time to negative results of	
urine culture but that the frequency of negative urine culture

results was the same in both treatment groups 2 weeks after	
the end of therapy (∼60% for catheterized patients and ∼73%	
for noncatheterized patients) [168]. The minimal utility of antifungal therapy against urinary candidiasis is also supported	
by a recent large observational study [169]. On the other hand,	
candidal urinary tract infections that were accompanied by	
radiographic evidence of a bezoar have responded to ﬂuconazole alone [131]. In other patients (e.g., those with obstructive	
uropathy), candiduria may rarely be the source of subsequent	
dissemination [170] or a marker of acute hematogenous dissemination [166]. These concerns are especially applicable to	
neutropenic patients, patients without current or recent placement of medical instruments in the urinary tract, and infants	
with low birth weight. Data on the outcome of therapy are	
limited by the heterogeneity of the underlying diseases and by	
the lack of clear deﬁnitions.	
Values.	
Treatment of asymptomatic candiduria in nonneutropenic catheterized patients has never been shown to be	
of value. Treatment with ﬂuconazole will brieﬂy clear funguria	
in approximately one-half of treated patients, but recurrence	
is prompt, selection of resistant Candida species is possible, and	
therapy does not appear to alter clinical outcome [168]. Candiduria in neutropenic patients, critically ill patients in ICUs,	
infants with low birth weight, and recipients of a transplant	
may be an indicator of disseminated candidiasis.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Treatment of appropriately selected patients may reduce the risk of ascending and/or hematogenously disseminated disease. Treatment of persistently	
febrile patients who have candiduria but who lack evidence for	
infection at other sites may treat occult disseminated candidiasis. Inappropriate therapy may select for resistant organisms.	
Key recommendations.	
Determination of the clinical relevance of candiduria can be difﬁcult [171]. Asymptomatic candiduria rarely requires therapy (D-III). Candiduria may, however,	
be	
the	
only	
microbiological	
documentation	
of	
disseminated candidiasis. Candiduria should be treated in	
symptomatic patients, patients with neutropenia, infants with	
low birth weight, patients with renal allografts, and patients	
who will undergo urologic manipulations (B-III). However,	
short courses of therapy are not recommended; therapy for 7–	
14 days is more likely to be successful. Removal of urinary tract	
instruments, including stents and Foley catheters, is often helpful. If complete removal is not possible, placement of new	
devices may be beneﬁcial. Treatment with ﬂuconazole (200 mg/	
day for 7–14 days) and with amphotericin B deoxycholate at	
widely ranging doses (0.3–1.0 mg/kg per day for 1–7 days) has	
been successful [172] (B-II). In the absence of renal insufﬁciency, oral ﬂucytosine (25 mg/kg q.i.d.) may be valuable for	
eradicating candiduria in patients with urologic infection due	
to non-albicans species of Candida (C-III). However,emergence	
of resistance may occur rapidly when this compound is used	
as a single agent [173]. Bladder irrigation with amphotericin	
B deoxycholate (50–200 mg/mL) may transiently clear funguria	
[174] but is rarely indicated (C-III), except as a diagnostic	
localizing tool [175]. Even with apparently successful local or	
systemic antifungal therapy for candiduria, relapse is frequent,	
and this likelihood is increased by continued use of a urinary	
catheter. Persistent candiduria in immunocompromised patients warrants ultrasonography or CT of the kidney (C-III).	
LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT CANDIDIASIS	
(PULMONARY AND LARYNGEAL	
CANDIDIASIS)	
Objective.	
To eradicate infection and prevent airway obstruction and loss of pulmonary reserve.	
Treatment options.	
Intravenous amphotericin B or oral	
or intravenous ﬂuconazole.	
Outcomes.	
For pneumonia, treatment clears local sites of	
infection along with any associated sites of systemic infection.	
For laryngitis, early clinical detection and documentation by	
ﬁberoptic or indirect laryngoscopy demonstrates localization of	
lesions and assessment of airway patency, permits acquisition	
of samples for culture, and enables rapid initiation of antifungal	
therapy. Impending airway obstruction is managed by endotracheal intubation. Successful medical therapy resolves laryngeal stridor, prevents airway obstruction, and reduces the risk	
of aspiration.	
Evidence.	
Observational reports and case series have	
shown that proven Candida pneumonia is associated with high	
mortality among patients with malignancies [176]. No convincing data for any particular form of therapy exist. Data for	
laryngitis are based on small series and individual case reports	
[177, 178]. Most cases have been managed with amphotericin	
B therapy, but milder cases been successfully managed with	
ﬂuconazole therapy [179, 180].	
Values.	
Candida pneumonia seems to exist in 2 forms.	
Rarely, after aspiration of oropharyngeal material, primary	
pneumonia due to Candida may develop [176, 181,182]. More	
commonly, hematogenously disseminated candidiasis produces	
pulmonary lesions, along with involvement of multiple additional organs. Firm diagnosis of these disease entities is elusive	
and requires histopathological conﬁrmation. Benign colonization of the airway with Candida species and/or contamination	
of the respiratory secretions with oropharyngeal material is	
much more common than either form of true Candida pneumonia. Thus, diagnoses of Candida pneumonia that are based	
solely on microbiological data are often incorrect [183, 184]	
(B-III).	
If not diagnosed and treated promptly, laryngitis may lead	
to airway obstruction and respiratory arrest.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Injudicious use of antifungal

therapy for patients with tracheobronchial colonization or oropharyngeal contamination of respiratory secretions may lead	
to selection of resistant organisms. Deﬁnitive diagnosis of Candida pneumonia requires histopathological conﬁrmation. In	
contrast, because of the severe morbidity and potential mortality associated with laryngeal candidiasis, rapid clinical diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy are important and	
outweigh any adverse effects of antifungal therapy.	
Key recommendations.	
Most patients with primary Candida pneumonia and laryngeal candidiasis have been treated	
with amphotericin B (0.7–1.0 mg/kg per day) (B-III). In cases	
of secondary pneumonia associated with hematogenously disseminated infection, therapy directed at disseminated candidiasis, rather than at Candida pneumonia in particular, is indicated (see the section Candidemia and Acute Hematogenously Disseminated Candidiasis, above). For candidal laryngitis, ﬂuconazole is a suitable alternative in milder cases (BIII).	
CANDIDAL OSTEOMYELITIS (INCLUDING	
MEDIASTINITIS) AND ARTHRITIS	
Objective.	
To relieve symptoms and eradicate infection.	
Treatment options.	
After open or arthroscopic debridement or drainage, both intravenous amphotericin B and oral	
or intravenous ﬂuconazole have been used.	
Outcomes.	
Eradication of infection and symptoms and	
return of joint function.	
Evidence.	
Multiple observational studies have been reported, most of which have used intravenous amphotericin B	
as the primary therapy, sometimes followed by a course of	
treatment with an azole antifungal agent. A few reports have	
described initial therapy with an azole.	
Values.	
Untreated disease leads to crippling disability.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
The high morbidity associated	
with untreated disease makes aggressive surgical and medical	
therapy appropriate. The presentation of candidal mediastinitis	
may be indolent and delayed [185]. Surgical debridement, biopsy, and drainage also serve to provide more-deﬁnitive histopathological and microbiological documentation before initiation of the prolonged therapy required for this class of	
infection.	
Key recommendations.	
Osteomyelitis is best treated with	
combined surgical debridement of the affected area, especially	
in the case of vertebral osteomyelitis, and antifungal therapy	
[186]. Courses of amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.5–1 mg/kg	
per day for 6–10 weeks) have been used successfully [187–189].	
Fluconazole has been used successfully as initial therapy for	
susceptible isolates in 3 reports in which doses of 6 mg/kg per	
day for 6–12 months were effective [190–192]. Addition of	
amphotericin B deoxycholate to bone cement appears safe and	
may be of value in complicated cases [193]. Taken together,	
these data suggest that surgical debridement and an initial	
course of amphotericin B for 2–3 weeks followed by ﬂuconazole, for a total duration of therapy of 6–12 months, would be	
rational (B-III).	
Deﬁnitive information on treatment of native joint arthritis	
is limited. Adequate drainage is critical to successful therapy	
[194]. In particular, management of Candida arthritis of the	
hip requires open drainage. Case reports have documented	
cures with administration of intravenous amphotericin B [195]	
and with ﬂuconazole when administered in conjunction with	
adequate drainage. Fluconazole has occasionally been used	
alone successfully [196]. As parenteral administration of these	
agents produces substantial synovial ﬂuid levels, the utility of	
intra-articular therapy is discouraged. Prolonged courses of	
therapy similar to those used for treating osteomyelitis appear	
to be required (C-III).	
Although success with medical therapy alone has been described [197], Candida arthritis that involves a prosthetic joint	
generally requires resection arthroplasty [198]. Subsequent	
medical therapy mirrors that for native joint disease, and a new	
prosthesis may be inserted after successful clearance of the local	
infection (C-III).	
On the basis of a small number of cases, Candida mediastinitis	
may be treated successfully with surgical debridement followed	
by either amphotericin B or ﬂuconazole therapy [185, 199] (IIIC). Irrigation of the mediastinal space with amphotericin B is	
not recommended, because it may cause chemical mediastinitis.	
Prolonged courses of therapy, similar to those needed for osteomyelitis at other sites, appear to be appropriate (C-III).	
CANDIDAL INFECTIONS OF THE	
GALLBLADDER, PANCREAS, AND	
PERITONEUM	
Objective.	
To eradicate Candida infection and prevent recurrence of infection.	
Treatment options.	
Intravenous amphotericin B or oral	
or intravenous ﬂuconazole.	
Outcome.	
Clearance of infection, as judged by resolution	
of local signs and symptoms along with sterilization of cultures.	
Evidence.	
Treatment of Candida infection of the pancreas	
and biliary tree has been described in case reports and small	
series. Successful therapy with either amphotericin B or ﬂuconazole has been described.	
Values.	
There are 2 major syndromes of peritoneal candidiasis. In disease associated with use of catheters for peritoneal dialysis, catheter removal is often required for successful	
therapy [200–203]. Both systemic amphotericin B and ﬂuconazole therapies have been used successfully [201–203].	
Candida peritonitis may also develop in association with

surgical or traumatic injury to the gut wall. Others at risk	
include patients who recently received chemotherapy for neoplasm or immunosuppressive therapy for transplantation or	
to those with inﬂammatory diseases [204]. Candida is usually	
part of a polymicrobial infection, and case series suggest that	
therapy directed toward Candida species is indicated, particularly when Candida organisms are isolated as part of a complex	
infection or in an immunocompromised patient [205–209].	
Uncontrolled Candida superinfection has been associated with	
signiﬁcant mortality in patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis [210–213]. A recent small but placebo-controlled trial	
demonstrated that ﬂuconazole (400 mg/day) reduced the likelihood of developing symptomatic Candida peritonitis in surgical patients with recurrent gastrointestinal perforations or	
anastomotic leakage [214].	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Routine treatment of Candida	
isolated following prompt and deﬁnitive repair of an acutely	
perforated viscus in otherwise healthy patients without signs	
of sepsis is probably not needed and could lead to selection of	
resistant organisms.	
Key recommendations.	
Disease of the biliary tree should	
be treated by mechanical restoration of functional drainage,	
combined with therapy with either amphotericin B or ﬂuconazole (C-III). Both agents achieve therapeutic biliary concentrations, and local instillation is not needed [215]. Catheterassociated peritonitis is treated with catheter removal and	
systemic treatment with amphotericin B or ﬂuconazole (B-III).	
After removal of the peritoneal dialysis catheter and a delay of	
at least 2 weeks, a new catheter may be placed (B-III) [200].	
Intraperitoneal amphotericin B has been associated with painful	
chemical peritonitis and should, in general, be avoided. Candida peritonitis related to intra-abdominal leakage of fecal material is treated with surgical repair, drainage, and therapy with	
either amphotericin B or ﬂuconazole (C-III). The required duration of therapy for all forms of Candida peritonitis is not	
well deﬁned and should be guided by the patient’s response.	
In general, 2–3 weeks of therapy seems to be required. Surgical	
patients with recurrent gastrointestinal perforation are at increased risk for Candida peritonitis and may beneﬁt from prophylactic antifungal therapy (B-I).	
CANDIDAL ENDOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS,	
SUPPURATIVE PHLEBITIS, AND MYOCARDITIS	
Objective.	
To eradicate Candida infection and prevent recurrence of infection.	
Treatment options.	
Intravenous amphotericin B or oral	
or intravenous ﬂuconazole. Oral ﬂucytosine may be added to	
amphotericin B.	
Outcome.	
Clearance of infection, as judged by sterilization	
of the bloodstream and preservation of cardiac function.	
Evidence.	
All data are derived from individual case reports	
and case series.	
Values.	
Although the available data are limited [216], combined medical and surgical therapy generally appears to be the	
key for treatment of candidal endocarditis, pericarditis, and	
suppurative phlebitis. As emphasized by a report of a native	
valve that was not sterilized after 160 days of amphotericin B	
deoxycholate therapy [217], removal of infected valves, resection of infected peripheral veins, and debridement of infected	
pericardial tissue are almost always required for successful therapy [218, 219]. Suppurative phlebitis of the central veins has	
responded to prolonged medical therapy with amphotericin B	
[220–222]. Suppurative peripheral thrombophlebitis responds	
to surgical resection of the infected vein and antifungal therapy	
with amphotericin B or ﬂuconazole [223]. The utility of anticoagulation as part of such purely medical therapy is uncertain. Candidal myocarditis is usually part of the syndrome of	
disseminated candidiasis, is clinically silent, and is treated as	
part of the therapy of disseminated disease [224]. However,	
candidal myocarditis may cause complete atrioventricular	
block, necessitating placement of a pacemaker [225].	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
These infections are associated	
with high morbidity and mortality, justifying aggressivemedical	
and surgical therapy.	
Key recommendations.	
Both native valve and prosthetic	
valve infection should be managed with surgical replacement	
of the infected valve. Medical therapy with amphotericin B with	
or without ﬂucytosine at maximal tolerated doses has most	
often been used (B-III). Total duration of therapy should be	
at least 6 weeks after surgery, but possibly much longer (CIII). Candida endocarditis has a propensity for relapse and	
requires careful follow-up for at least 1 year [227]. If valve	
replacement is not possible, long-term (possibly life-long) suppressive therapy with ﬂuconazole may be used (C-III) [216,	
228, 229]. Successful primary therapy with ﬂuconazole [105]	
and liposomal amphotericin B [230] has been described for	
patients with native valve infections.	
Candidal pericarditis requires surgical debridement and/or	
resection, depending on the extent of the disease [231, 232].	
Cardiac tamponade is possible and may require an emergency	
procedure to relieve hemodynamic compromise. Prolonged	
therapy with amphotericin B [219] or ﬂuconazole should be	
used (C-III).	
Suppurative Candida thrombophlebitis of a peripheral vein	
is best managed with surgical resection of the involved vein	
segment, followed by antifungal therapy for 2 weeks (B-III).	
After vein resection, the general approach to this disease is	
similar to that for other forms of acute hematogenous	
dissemination.

CANDIDAL MENINGITIS	
Objective.	
To achieve rapid clearance of the infection and	
the return of normal neurological function.	
Treatment options.	
Intravenous amphotericin B or ﬂuconazole. Flucytosine may be added to the course of amphotericin B.	
Outcomes.	
Sterilization of the CSF often precedes eradication of parenchymal infection. Thus, therapy should be continued until normalization of all CSF analysis ﬁndings, normalization	
of	
radiological	
ﬁndings, and stabilization of	
neurological function.	
Evidence.	
Most data are based on observational reports	
of use of amphotericin B deoxycholate [233, 234]. Liposomal	
amphotericin B was used successfully in 5 of 6 cases of Candida	
meningitis in newborn infants [235]. Because of its ability to	
penetrate the blood-brain barrier, ﬂucytosine is often added to	
the course of therapy [236]. Fluconazole with ﬂucytosine was	
used successfully in 1 case [237].	
Values.	
Candida meningitis often follows candidemia in	
newborn infants [234] and has a high propensity for relapse.	
Untreated disease is lethal.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Because of the high morbidity	
and mortality associated with this infection, very aggressive	
therapy is warranted.	
Key recommendations.	
Amphotericin B deoxycholate	
(0.7–1 mg/kg per day) plus ﬂucytosine (25 mg/kg q.i.d.) is	
appropriate as initial therapy (B-III). The ﬂucytosine dose	
should be adjusted to produce serum levels of 40–60 mg/mL	
[173]. Very few data exist on ﬂuconazole for the treatment of	
candidal meningitis—it has been used as both follow-up therapy and long-term suppressive therapy. Because of the tendency	
for this disease to relapse, therapy should be administered for	
a minimum of 4 weeks after resolution of all signs and symptoms associated with the infection. Treatment of Candida meningitis associated with neurosurgical procedures should also	
include removal of prosthetic devices [238, 239].	
CANDIDAL ENDOPHTHALMITIS	
Objective.	
To resolve sight-threatening lesions.	
Treatment options.	
Intravenous amphotericin B has been	
used most often [240, 241]. Recent reports have also examined	
the efﬁcacy of oral or intravenous ﬂuconazole [242]. Flucytosine has been used in combination with amphotericin B.	
ABLC (4.5 mg/kg per day for 6 weeks) combined with vitrectomy produced a successful outcome in 1 case [243]. Vitrectomy may sometimes preserve sight. The role of intravitreal	
antifungal therapy is unclear.	
Outcome.	
Preservation of sight.	
Evidence.	
Individual case reports and small case series have	
demonstrated that amphotericin B, amphotericin B plus ﬂucytosine, and ﬂuconazole may be effective. PCR-based testing	
may assist in conﬁrming the diagnosis [244, 245]. The role of	
vitrectomy in therapy remains uncertain, but a recent study of	
C. albicans endophthalmitis in injection drug users suggested	
that the combination of early vitrectomy plus antifungal therapy was most likely to lead to a favorable outcome and preservation of vision. [246]. Of additional interest is a recent randomized study of therapy for bacterial endophthalmitis	
sponsored by the National Eye Institute, in which initial pars	
plana vitrectomy with use of intravitreal antibiotics followed	
by a second vitreous tap and reinjection of eyes that had a poor	
response to therapy after 36–60 h was compared with a strategy	
of initial anterior chamber and vitreous tap and/or biopsy	
[247]. For patients in this study who presented with visual	
acuity of light perception only, initial vitrectomy tripled the	
chance of achieving acuity of 20/40 or better. These results are	
supported by anecdotal reports [248].	
Values.	
Early aggressive therapy is critically important.Delays in diagnosis may lead to loss of vision.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Given the devastating consequences associated with loss of sight, aggressive therapy is	
warranted.	
Key recommendations.	
All patients with candidemia	
should have at least 1 dilated retinal examination, preferably	
by an ophthalmologist (A-II). The preponderance of clinical	
experience of treatment is with amphotericin B, often combined	
with ﬂucytosine (B-III). Recent data also support the use of	
ﬂuconazole for this indication, particularly as follow-up therapy	
(B-III). Use of the maximal doses appropriate for other forms	
of invasive candidiasis would be appropriate to maximize penetration into the eye. Therapy should be continued until complete resolution of visible disease or convincing stabilization.	
Courses of 6–12 weeks of therapy are typically required.	
A diagnostic vitreal aspirate is generally recommended for	
patients presenting with endophthalmitis of unknown origin.	
If fungal elements are observed, some ophthalmologists instill	
intravitreal amphotericin B deoxycholate therapy. The utility	
of vitrectomy has not been systematically studied.Extrapolation	
from a study of bacterial endophthalmitis [247] and from anecdotal experiences with Candida endophthalmitis [246] suggests that initial vitrectomy and intravitreal amphotericin B	
therapy may be most appropriate for patients with substantial	
vision loss.	
NONGENITAL MUCOCUTANEOUS

oral azoles (ﬂuconazole, ketoconazole, or itraconazole), or oral	
polyenes (such as nystatin or oral amphotericin B) are usually	
effective treatments for oropharyngeal candidiasis. For refractory or recurrent infections, orally administered and absorbed	
azoles (ketoconazole, ﬂuconazole, or itraconazole solution),	
amphotericin B suspension, intravenous caspofungin, or intravenous amphotericin B (only for otherwise unresponsive infections) may be used.	
For treatment of esophageal candidiasis, topical therapy is	
ineffective. Azoles (ﬂuconazole, itraconazole solution, or voriconazole), intravenous caspofungin, and intravenous amphotericin B (necessary only for otherwise unresponsive infections)	
are effective. for patients who are unable to swallow, parenteral	
therapy should be used.	
Outcome.	
Resolution of disease without recurrence.	
Evidence.	
Multiple randomized prospective studies of oropharyngeal candidiasis have been performed in patients with	
AIDS and patients with cancer. Most patients respond initially	
to topical therapy [249–251]. In HIV-infected patients, symptomatic relapses may occur sooner with topical therapy than	
with ﬂuconazole [249], and resistance may develop with either	
regimen [252]. Fluconazole is superior to ketoconazole [253].	
Itraconazole capsules are equivalent in efﬁcacy to ketoconazole	
[254]. Itraconazole solution is better absorbed than the capsules	
[255] and is comparable in efﬁcacy to ﬂuconazole [256–258].	
A dosage of itraconazole solution of 2.5 mg/kg twice daily has	
been recommended as suitable for treating oropharyngeal candidiasis in pediatric patients 5 years of age [96]. Topical effects	
of oral solutions may be as important as effects due to absorption [259, 260].	
Recurrent infections typically occur in patients with immunosuppression, especially AIDS. Long-term suppressive	
therapy with ﬂuconazole is effective in the prevention of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with AIDS [32, 261–263]	
and patients with cancer [264]. One study found that a ﬂuconazole dosage of 200 mg/day was superior to that of 400 mg/	
week for prevention of symptomatic oropharyngeal disease in	
HIV-infected patients [262]. Long-term suppressive therapy	
with ﬂuconazole in HIV-infected patients has been shown to	
reduce the incidence of invasive fungal infections but has no	
effect on overall survival [32, 261–263]. In a recent large study,	
long-term suppressive therapy with ﬂuconazole was compared	
with episodic use of ﬂuconazole in response to symptomatic	
mucosal disease. Continuous suppressive therapy reduced the	
relapse rate relative to intermittent therapy and was associated	
with an increased rate of development of in vitro microbiological resistance, but the frequency of clinically refractory disease was the same for the 2 study groups [263].	
Oral polyenes, such as amphotericin B or nystatin, are less	
effective than ﬂuconazole in preventing this infection [265]. In	
a placebo-controlled study of HIV-infected patients [266], itraconazole (200 mg/day) was no more effective than placebo for	
preventing development of mucosal candidiasis. However, a	
second study found that itraconazole (200 mg/day) was effective as suppressive therapy for up to 6 months after a course	
of oral or esophageal candidiasis [267]. Between 64% and 80%	
of patients with ﬂuconazole-refractory infections will respond	
to treatment with itraconazole solution [268–270]. Intravenous	
caspofungin is a reasonable alternative [58]. Oral or intravenous	
amphotericin B is also effective in some patients [271]. Intravenous antifungal therapy can sometimes be avoided by using	
either IFN-g or GM-CSF in combination with oral antifungal	
therapy [272, 273]. However, a second study found that itraconazole (200 mg/day) was effective as suppressive therapy for	
up to 6 months after an episode of oral or esophageal candidiasis [267]. Itraconazole oral solution has also proven to be	
effective in cases of ﬂuconazole-refractory oral candidiasis	
[268–270]. Oral solution of amphotericin B has also been successfully used to treat ﬂuconazole-resistant thrush [271]. Finally,	
immunomodulation	
with	
adjunctive	
sargramostim	
(rGM-CSF) [272] and INF-g [273] have been used for refractory oral candidiasis.	
Much of the information on the microbiology of esophageal	
candidiasis is extrapolated from studies of oropharyngeal candidiasis. However, it is known that in patients with either AIDS	
or esophageal cancer, C. albicans remains the most common	
etiological agent [274, 275]. The presence of oropharyngeal	
candidiasis and symptoms of esophagitis (i.e., dysphagia or	
odynophagia) is predictive of esophageal candidiasis [276]. A	
therapeutic trial with ﬂuconazole for patients with presumed	
esophageal candidiasis is a cost-effective alternative to endoscopy; most patients with esophageal candidiasis will have resolution of their symptoms within 7 days after the start of therapy [277]. Fluconazole is superior to ketoconazole, itraconazole	
capsules, and ﬂucytosine for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis [278–280]. Itraconazole capsules plus ﬂucytosine are	
as effective as ﬂuconazole [281]. The efﬁcacy of itraconazole	
solution has been shown to comparable to that of ﬂuconazole	
[282]. Up to 80% of patients with ﬂuconazole-refractory infections will respond to itraconazole solution [269, 270]. Voriconazole (200 mg b.i.d. for a median duration of 14 days) is	
as efﬁcacious as ﬂuconazole (400 mg loading dose followed by	
200 mg/day for a median duration of 15 days) but is associated	
with a higher rate of treatment-related adverse events [46].	
Voriconazole has shown success in treatment of cases of ﬂuconazole-refractory disease [48]. Intravenous amphotericin B	
is also effective [283]. Caspofungin acetate has shown activity	
and safety equivalent to ﬂuconazole [58–60], including good	
responses in individuals with ﬂuconazole-refractory disease	
[61]. In patients with advanced AIDS, recurrent infections are	
common [284], and long-term suppressive therapy with ﬂuDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/38/2/161/286280 by guest on 14 January 2025

conazole (100 mg/day) is effective in preventing recurrence	
[285].	
In cases of both oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis,	
the vast majority of infections are caused by C. albicans, either	
alone or in mixed infection [250]. However, symptomatic infections caused by C. glabrata and C. krusei alone have been	
described [268]. Before the HAART era, azole-refractory infections were associated with prior use of azoles, especially oral	
ﬂuconazole, and CD4 cell counts of !50 cells/mm3 [286]. A	
large randomized trial performed during the HAART era found	
that the rate of development of clinical ﬂuconazole resistance	
was the same for individuals receiving long-term suppressive	
therapy as for those receiving episodic (intermittent) therapy	
[263], even though the Candida isolates recovered from the	
patients receiving continuous therapy showed reduced susceptibility to ﬂuconazole. Antifungal susceptibility testing has been	
shown to be predictive of clinical response to ﬂuconazole and	
itraconazole [30]. In HIV-infected patients, use of HAART has	
been associated with both declining rates of carriage of C. albicans and reduced frequency of symptomatic episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis [287].	
Values.	
The symptoms associated with oropharyngeal and	
esophageal candidiasis may reduce oral intake of food and liquids and may signiﬁcantly reduce the quality of life.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Maintenance of adequate nutrition and hydration is essential for immunocompromised	
hosts. Many individuals have asymptomatic oropharyngeal colonization with Candida species, and treatment frequently does	
not result in microbiological cure. Therefore, oropharyngeal	
fungal cultures are of little beneﬁt. Multiple courses of therapy	
or the use of suppressive therapy for recurrent infection are	
major risk factors for the development of an azole-refractory	
infection.	
Key recommendations.	
Initial episodes of oropharyngeal	
candidiasis can be treated with clotrimazole troches (one 10mg troche 5 times per day) or nystatin (available as a suspension	
of 100,000 U/mL [dosage, 4–6 mL q.i.d.] or as ﬂavored 200,000	
U pastilles [dosage, 1 or 2 pastilles 4–5 times per day for 7–	
14 days]) (B-II). Oral ﬂuconazole (100 mg/day for 7–14 days)	
is as effective as—and, in some studies, superior to—topical	
therapy (A-I). Itraconazole solution (200 mg/day for 7–14 days)	
is as efﬁcacious as ﬂuconazole (A-I). Ketoconazole and itraconazole capsules are less effective than ﬂuconazole, because	
of variable absorption (A-I).	
Patients tolerate repeated episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis without difﬁculty, especially if the episodes occur infrequently (A-I). Suppressive therapy is effective for preventing	
recurrent infections (A-I). Although it does the increase the	
rate of development of isolates with an increased ﬂuconazole	
MIC, the use of continuous suppression (rather than episodic	
or intermittent therapy in response to symptomatic relapse)	
does not increase the likelihood of developing an infection that	
fails to respond to ﬂuconazole (A-I).	
Fluconazole-refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis will respond to oral itraconazole therapy (200 mg/day, preferably	
in solution form) approximately two-thirds of the time (A-II).	
An oral suspension of amphotericin B (1 mL q.i.d. of the 100	
mg/mL suspension) is sometimes effective in patients who do	
not respond to itraconazole (B-II). There have also been anecdotal reports of responses of refractory disease to use of	
ﬂuconazole solution (used in a swish-and-swallow fashion)	
[260] and to use of chewed itraconazole capsules. Intravenous	
caspofungin (50 mg/day) and intravenous amphotericin B	
deoxycholate (0.3 mg/kg per day) are usually effective and	
may be used in patients with refractory disease (B-II). Denturerelated disease may require extensive and aggressivedisinfection	
of the denture for deﬁnitive cure [288–290].	
Systemic therapy is required for effective treatment of esophageal candidiasis (B-II). Although symptoms of esophageal candidiasis may be mimicked by other pathogens, a diagnostic trial	
of antifungal therapy is often appropriate before performing	
endoscopy (B-II). A 14–21-day course of either oral ﬂuconazole	
(100 mg/day po) or itraconazole solution (200 mg/day po) is	
highly effective (A-I). Ketoconazole and itraconazole capsules	
are less effective than ﬂuconazole, because of variable absorption (A-I). Voriconazole is as effective as ﬂuconazole but is	
associated with more adverse events (A-I). Caspofungin (50	
mg/day iv) is as efﬁcacious as amphotericin B or ﬂuconazole	
(A-I). Suppressive therapy may be used for patients with disabling	
recurrent	
infections	
(A-II).	
Fluconazole-refractory	
esophageal candidiasis should be treated with itraconazole solution (200 mg/day po), voriconazole (200 mg b.i.d.), or	
caspofungin (50 mg/day) (A-II). Intravenous amphotericin B	
deoxycholate (0.3–0.7 mg/kg per day, as needed to produce a	
response) may be used for patients with otherwise refractory	
disease (B-II).	
Antifungal susceptibility testing is not generally needed for	
the management of either oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis, but can be useful in patients with refractory infection	
(B-II). In patients with AIDS, treatment of the underlying HIV	
infection with HAART is critical for preventing and managing	
these infections (B-II).	
Candidal Onychomycosis	
Whereas onychomycosis is usually caused by a dermatophyte,	
infections due to Candida species also occur [291]. Topical	
agents are usually ineffective [292]. For onychomycosis, oral	
griseofulvin has largely been replaced by more-effective agents,	
including oral terbinaﬁne or itraconazole [293]. With respect	
to Candida onychomycosis, terbinaﬁne has only limited and	
unpredictable in vitro activity [294, 295] and has not demonstrated consistently good activity in clinical trials [296]. AlDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/38/2/161/286280 by guest on 14 January 2025

vaginitis.	
b Patients with any of these features are considered to have complicated

though the number of reported cases is small, therapy with	
itraconazole does appear to be effective [297, 298]. Itraconazole	
(200 mg b.i.d. for 1 week, repeated monthly for 3–4 months)	
appears to be the most appropriate treatment (A-II).	
Candidal Skin Infections and Paronychia	
Nonhematogenous primary skin infections typically occur as	
intertrigo in skin folds, especially in obese and diabetic patients.	
Topical azoles and polyenes, including clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin, are effective. Keeping the infected area dry	
is important. For paronychia, the most important intervention	
is drainage.	
Mammary Candidiasis	
Although a clear association remains to be determined, because	
of the lack of application of consistent clinical and microbiological criteria, nipple or breast pain in nursing mothers has	
been linked to the presence of C. albicans [299]. Nursing worsens or precipitates the pain. Classical ﬁndings of mastitis are	
absent, as is fever, and the ﬁndings of a local physical examination are often unimpressive [300]. The infant may or may	
not have signs of mucosal or cutaneous candidiasis. Microbiological studies have found both bacteria [300, 301] and C.	
albicans [300], with bacteria appearing to predominate. The	
true cause of the pain associated with this syndrome is unclear,	
but treatment of the mother and the infant with an antifungal	
agent has produced relief, according to some reports [302, 303].	
Optimal diagnostic criteria and management strategies are not	
certain, but both topical nystatin and oral ﬂuconazole are safe	
for infants [304–306] and could be considered as therapy for	
mother and child if the presentation is strongly suggestive of	
candidiasis.	
Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis	
The persistent immunological defect associated with chronic	
mucocutaneous candidiasis requires a long-term approach that	
is analogous to that used in patients with AIDS and rapidly	
relapsing oropharyngeal candidiasis [307]. Systemic therapy is	
needed, and all of the azole antifungal agents (ketoconazole,	
ﬂuconazole, and itraconazole) have been used successfully [307,	
308]. The required dosages are similar to those used for other	
forms of mucocutaneous candidiasis. As with HIV-infected patients, development of resistance to these agents has also been	
described [309, 310].	
GENITAL CANDIDIASIS	
Objective.	
To achieve rapid and complete relief of signs	
and symptoms of vulvovaginal inﬂammation, along with prevention of future recurrences.	
Treatment options.	
Topical agents including azoles (all are	
used for 1–7 days depending on risk classiﬁcation: over-thecounter [OTC] clotrimazole, OTC butoconazole, OTC miconazole, OTC tioconazole, terconazole), nystatin [100,000 U per	
day for 7–14 days], oral azoles (ketoconazole [400 mg b.i.d.	
for 5 days], which is not approved in the United States); itraconazole [200 mg b.i.d. for 1 day, or 200 mg per day for 3	
days], which is not approved in the United States; and ﬂuconazole [150 mg]) [311]. Boric acid administered vaginally (600mg gelatin capsule, once per day for 14 days) is also effective	
[312].	
Outcomes.	
Resolution of signs and symptoms of vaginitis	
48–72 h after initiation of therapy, and mycological cure 4–7	
days after initiation of therapy.	
Evidence.	
Multiple double-blind randomized studies [311,	
313, 314].	
Values.	
Highly effective relief of symptoms that are associated with substantial morbidity can be achieved promptly	
with current therapies.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Self-diagnosis of yeast vaginitis	
is unreliable. Incorrect diagnosis results in overuse of topical	
antifungal agents, with subsequent risk of contact and irritant	
vulvar dermatitis.	
Key recommendations.	
Vaginal candidiasis may be classiﬁed into complicated and uncomplicated forms (table 5)	
[315]. Uncomplicated vaginitis is seen in 90% of patients and	
responds readily to short-course oral or topical therapy with	
any of the therapies listed above, including the single-dose regimens (A-I). In contrast, the complicated vaginitis seen in	
∼10% of patients requires antimycotic therapy for 7 days,	
either daily as topical therapy or as two 150-mg doses of ﬂuconazole administered 72 h apart [314] (A-I). Azole therapy is	
unreliable for non-albicans species of Candida (B-III). Infections with C. glabrata, C. krusei [316], and the other nonalbicans species frequently respond to topical boric acid (600	
mg/day for 14 days (B-II) or topical ﬂucytosine (B-II). Azoleresistant C. albicans infections are extremely rare [317].	
Recurrent vaginitis is usually due to azole-susceptible C. alDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/38/2/161/286280 by guest on 14 January 2025

bicans. After control of causal factors (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes), induction therapy with 2 weeks of a topical or oral azole	
should be followed by a maintenance regimen for 6 months.	
Suitable maintenance regimens include ﬂuconazole (150 mg po	
every week) [318], ketoconazole (100 mg per day) [319], itraconazole (100 mg q.o.d.) or daily therapy with any topical azole	
(A-I). Chronic use of ﬂuconazole in HIV-infected women has	
been associated with increased vaginal carriage of non-albicans	
species of Candida [320], but the signiﬁcance of this observation is uncertain.	
PROPHYLAXIS	
HIV-Infected Patients	
See the subsection Oropharyngeal and Esophageal Candidiasis,

Neutropenic Patients	
Objective.	
To prevent development of invasive fungal infections during periods of risk.	
Treatment options.	
Intravenous amphotericin B, intravenous or oral ﬂuconazole, intravenous or oral itraconazole,	
or intravenous micafungin (under investigation; see the subsection Key recommendations, below)	
Outcomes.	
Prevention of onset of signs and symptoms of	
invasive candidiasis.	
Evidence.	
Randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled	
trials have shown that systemically active antifungal agents can	
reduce the rate of development of superﬁcial and invasive Candida infections in high-risk patients [321]. The best data have	
compared the efﬁcacy of ﬂuconazole (400 mg/day) with that	
of placebo in bone-marrow transplant recipients [322, 323]	
and/or patients receiving intensive cytotoxic therapy for acute	
leukemia [324]. Itraconazole (2.5 mg/kg q12h po) was at least	
as effective overall as ﬂuconazole (100 mg/day po) and better	
for prevention of aspergillosis when used as prophylaxis in	
patients undergoing chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation for hematological malignancy [325]. Micafungin (50 mg/	
day iv during the period of neutropenia) reduced the use of	
empirical amphotericin B, relative to that of ﬂuconazole (400	
mg/day), as prophylaxis during the neutropenic phase in bone	
marrow transplant recipients and was associated with a trend	
toward lower rates of aspergillosis in micafungin-treated patients [69]. Although continuing prophylaxis for the minimum	
duration in which the patient is at risk for neutropenia seems	
appropriate, prophylaxis in bone marrow transplant recipients	
beyond the period of engraftment was, in one large randomized	
placebo-controlled study, associated with a signiﬁcant mortality beneﬁt [322, 326]. The utility of other potentially active	
agents (e.g., amphotericin B) may be limited by toxicity or	
bioavailability.	
Values.	
Prevention of invasive fungal infection lowers	
morbidity and infection-related mortality [321]. Observed effects on overall mortality have either been none [323] or beneﬁcial [322], but these 2 studies did demonstrate a reduction	
in the rate of fungus-associated deaths.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Inappropriate use of prophylaxis for low-risk patient populations could apply epidemiological pressure that could select for resistant organisms.	
Key recommendations.	
Fluconazole (400 mg/day) or itraconazole solution (2.5 mg/kg q12h po during the period of risk	
for neutropenia) are appropriate therapies for patients who are	
at signiﬁcant risk for invasive candidiasis (A-I). Although not	
licensed at the time of this writing, micafungin demonstrated	
favorable activity, on the basis of results in the recently reported	
comparative trial [69], and may become an option for antifungal prophylaxis in neutropenic patients. Such patient groups	
might include patients receiving standard chemotherapy for	
acute myelogenous leukemia, allogeneic bone marrow transplants, or high-risk autologous bone marrow transplants. However, in this context, it is important to understand that, among	
these populations, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation protocols do not all produce equivalent risk and that	
local experience with particular chemotherapy and cytokine	
regimens should be used to determine the relevance of prophylaxis [327–329]. The optimal duration of prophylaxis is not	
known but should include the period of risk for neutropenia	
at a minimum.	
Solid-Organ Transplant Recipients	
Objective.	
To prevent development of invasive fungal infections during periods of risk.	
Treatment options.	
Intravenous amphotericin B or intravenous or oral ﬂuconazole.	
Outcomes.	
Prevention of onset of signs and symptoms of	
invasive candidiasis.	
Evidence.	
Patients undergoing liver transplantation who	
have 2 key risk factors (i.e., retransplantation, creatinine level	
of 12.0 mg/dL, choledochojejunostomy, intraoperative use of	
40 units of blood products, and fungal colonization detected	
2 days previous to and 3 days after transplantation) have	
been identiﬁed as being at high risk for invasive fungal infections, especially invasive candidiasis [330–332]. Conversely, patients without these risk factors are at low risk of invasive	
candidiasis [333]. Amphotericin B deoxycholate (10–20 mg/	
day in a retrospective observational study [334]), liposomal	
amphotericin B (1 mg/kg per day in a prospective randomized	
study vs. placebo [335]), and ﬂuconazole (100 mg/day in a	
retrospective observational study [336], 100 mg/day in a prospective randomized study vs. nystatin [337], and 400 mg/day	
in a prospective randomized study vs. placebo [338]) reduced	
or trended towards reducing rates of invasive fungal infections.

The largest and most convincing study was by Winston et al.	
[338], in which ﬂuconazole (400 mg/day) reduced rates of fungal infections (including superﬁcial infections) in a series of	
unselected patients from 23% to 6% (	
).	
P ! .001	
The risk for candidiasis among patients who received a pancreas transplant is probably less than that for those who received	
a liver transplant. A recent retrospective review of 445 consecutive pancreas transplant recipients revealed a 6% frequency of	
intra-abdominal fungal infection in those who received ﬂuconazole prophylaxis (400 mg/day) for 7 days after transplantation, compared with 10% for those who did not received	
prophylaxis [339]. There also was signiﬁcant improvement in	
1-year graft survival rate and overall survival among patients	
who had no infection. Prospective and case-controlled studies	
will further help to delineate the population of patients at high	
risk for invasive candidiasis and the potential beneﬁts of ﬂuconazole prophylaxis.	
Data from a small series of patients undergoing small-bowel	
transplantation documented 20 invasive fungal infections (16	
of which were due to Candida species) among 29 transplant	
recipients [340], which suggests a potential role for prophylaxis.	
The risk of invasive candidiasis after transplantation of other	
solid organs appears to be too low to warrant systemic prophylaxis [341].	
Value.	
Prevention of the signiﬁcant morbidity associated	
with invasive candidiasis is warranted.	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Injudicious use of prophylaxis	
for patients at low risk might lead to selection of resistant	
organisms.	
Key recommendations.	
High-risk recipients of liver transplants should receive prophylactic antifungal therapy during	
the early postoperative period (A-I).	
Patients in ICUs and Other Care Settings	
Objective.	
To prevent development of invasive fungal infections during periods of risk.	
Treatment options.	
Intravenous amphotericin B or intravenous or oral ﬂuconazole.	
Outcomes.	
Prevention of onset of signs and symptoms of	
invasive candidiasis.	
Evidence.	
This topic has been extensively reviewed, and	
prophylaxis may be warranted in hospital units that show very	
high rates of disease despite use of aggressive infection-control	
procedures [342]. Oral ﬂuconazole (400 mg/day) produced a	
trend toward decreased rates of invasive candidiasis in selected	
adult patients in the surgical ICU with an expected ICU stay	
of at least 3 days [343]. In preterm infants with birth weights	
of !1000 g, 6 weeks of ﬂuconazole therapy (3 mg/kg iv every	
third day during the ﬁrst 2 weeks of life, every other day during	
the third and fourth weeks of life, and every day during the	
ﬁfth and sixth weeks of life) reduced the rate of invasive candidiasis from 20% to 0% (	
) [344]. Fluconazole proP p .008	
phylaxis (400 mg/day) reduced the rate of candidal peritonitis	
in patients with refractory gastrointestinal perforation [214].	
Values.	
Prevention of the signiﬁcant morbidity associated	
with invasive candidiasis is warranted. Candidemia is associated	
with signiﬁcant costs [138].	
Beneﬁts, harms, and costs.	
Injudicious use of prophylaxis	
in low-risk hospital units where the risk of candidiasis is low	
might lead to selection of resistant organisms.	
Key recommendations.	
Knowledge about this class of infections is evolving. The primary data showing utility of prophylaxis are from studies at single centers with high baseline	
rates of infections. The broader applicability of these rules in	
other ICUs remains a subject of signiﬁcant debate. Institutions	
where high rates of invasive candidiasis in the adult or neonatal	
ICU persist despite standard infection-control procedurescould	
consider ﬂuconazole prophylaxis for carefully selected patients	
in these care areas (A-I).

Abstract	
Background	
The prevalence of candida esophagitis (CE) might be changing in an era of highly active	
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among HIV-infected patients or today’s rapidly aging society	
among non-HIV-infected patients. However, few studies have investigated long-term CE	
trends, and CE risk factors have not been studied in a large sample, case-control study.	
This study aimed to determine long-term trends in CE prevalence and associated risk factors for patients with or without HIV infection.	
Methods	
Trends in CE prevalence were explored in a cohort of 80,219 patients who underwent	
endoscopy between 2002 and 2014. Risks for CE were examined among a subcohort of	
6,011 patients. In risk analysis, we assessed lifestyles, infections, co-morbidities, immunosuppressants, and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). All patients were tested for HIV, hepatitis	
B or C virus, and syphilis infection. For HIV-infected patients, sexual behavior, CD4 cell	
count, history of HAART were also assessed.	
Results	
CE prevalence was 1.7% (1,375/80,219) in all patients, 9.8% (156/1,595) in HIV-infected	
patients, and 1.6% (1,219/78,624) in non-HIV-infected patients. CE prevalence from 2002PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0133589

2003 to 2012-2014 tended to increase in non-HIV-infected patients (0.6% to 2.5%; P<0.01)	
and decrease in HIV-infected patients (13.6% to 9.0%; P=0.097). Multivariate analysis	
revealed increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; p=0.007), HIV infection (OR, 4.92;	
p<0.001), and corticosteroid use (OR, 5.90; p<0.001) were significantly associated with CE,	
and smoking (OR, 1.32; p=0.085) and acetaminophen use (OR, 1.70; p=0.097) were marginally associated. No significant association was found with alcohol consumption, hepatitis	
B or C virus, syphilis, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease,	
chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, anticancer, or PPIs use. In HIV-infected patients,	
CD4 cell count <100/μL (OR, 4.83; p<0.001) and prior HAART (OR, 0.35; p=0.006) were	
independently associated with CE, but sexual behavior was not. Among corticosteroid	
users, CE was significantly associated with higher prednisone-equivalent dose (p=0.043 for	
trend test).	
Conclusions	
This large, endoscopy-based study demonstrated that CE prevalence increased in nonHIV-infected patients but decreased in HIV-infected patients over 13 years. Risk analysis	
revealed that increasing age, HIV infection, and corticosteroids use, particularly at higher	
doses, were independently associated with CE, but alcohol, other infections, diabetes, anticancer drugs, and PPIs use were not.	
Introduction	
Candida esophagitis (CE), one of the most common opportunistic infections of the esophagus	
[1], is classed as an invasive fungal disease [2]. Severe CE may cause esophageal hemorrhage or	
progress to stricture or fistula formation, accompanied by reduced quality of life. Early diagnosis and treatment with systemic antifungals is therefore important [3]. Endoscopy is an essential diagnostic tool for detecting fungal white plaque and performing biopsy [4], but it is too	
costly and invasive to be used in an unselected population. Therefore, high-risk patients must	
be identified to prevent delays in diagnosis and poor outcomes.	
Several studies have reported that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), immunosuppressants,	
and HIV infection are common risk factors for CE, although most of these studies did not have	
a case-control design, had a small samples, or were restricted to immunocompromised patients	
[5–8]. In today’s rapidly aging society, it is unclear whether these risk factors remain the same	
given that comorbidities in general are expected to rise with rapid aging of the population [9]	
and the suggested risk factors of PPIs and immunosuppressant drugs [6,8,10] are now in widespread clinical use. In contrast, it is known that HIV-related opportunistic infections have	
decreased dramatically following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy	
(HAART) [11,12]. Moreover, few studies have investigated CE risk factors in the recent decade	
and long-term trends in CE prevalence have not been studied to date [7,10]. In light of such	
societal changes, the risk factors for CE should be reconsidered and trends in CE prevalence	
investigated to facilitate timely diagnosis and treatment of the disease.	
Here we report the results of a large, endoscopy-based, cross-sectional, case-control study	
conducted over 13 years that aimed to identify trends in annual CE prevalence in patients with	
or without HIV infection and determine through risk analysis which lifestyle factors, medication, and comorbidities are associated with CE.

Materials and Methods	
Study design, setting, and participants	
We conducted two studies at the endoscopy unit of the National Center for Global Health and	
Medicine (NCGM; Tokyo, Japan) between January 2002 and April 2014, one to investigate CE	
prevalence and the other to examine risk factors for CE. This study was approved by the ethics	
committee of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine Center (Nos. 711, 1424) and	
was implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. NCGM has	
900 beds and is the largest referral center for HIV/AIDS in Japan. All patients underwent serological testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis before	
endoscopy [13]. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to endoscopy.	
In Study 1 to identify overall CE prevalence and trends in annual CE prevalence, we reviewed	
a hospital-based, prospectively collected endoscopic database of 80,360 consecutive patients	
who underwent upper endoscopy at NCGM between January 2002 and April 2014. Indications	
for endoscopy were as follows: (i) continual or intermittent upper GI symptoms; (ii) asymptomatic with anemia; (iii) asymptomatic requiring examination for specific diseases due to abnormal	
findings on tumor marker or fecal occult blood testing or on abdominal imaging; (iv) screening	
required for gastric cancer; and (v) therapeutic endoscopy required. In Japan, which has a high	
incidence of gastric cancer [14], endoscopy is frequently performed for gastric cancer screening	
[15]. We excluded patients who were 18 years of age or who did not provide informed consent. All inclusion and exclusion criteria were fullfilled before the patients were enrolled.	
In Study 2 to identify CE risk factors, we conducted a hospital-based, case-control study at	
the endoscopy unit of the NCGM between September 2009 and April 2014. Inclusion criteria	
were Japanese nationality and the aforementioned indications for endoscopy. Exclusion criteria	
were as follows: (i) no informed consent obtained; (ii) unknown use of medication; (iii) not	
independent in activities of daily living (ADL); (iv) inability to understand written documents;	
(v) use of any anti-fungal drugs within 1 month before endoscopy; (vi) urgent or early endoscopy for acute GI bleeding; and (vii) second endoscopy required during the study period. All	
inclusion and exclusion criteria were fullfilled before the patients were enrolled. The control	
group comprised 5,800 patients undergoing endoscopy during the same period who did not	
meet our criteria for the diagnosis of CE.	
Data sources and measurement	
For risk analysis, histories of HBV, HCV, and syphilis infection were collected before endoscopy	
and defined as presence of antibody against hepatitis B or C surface antigen and positive results	
on a Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test, respectively, as previously reported [13].	
A detailed questionnaire was also completed at the endoscopy unit on the same day as	
before endoscopy [16]. Well-trained medical researchers asked patients about alcohol consumption, smoking status, comorbidities, and medication use. Researchers also checked prescriptions and medical records in addition to the information provided by the patients to avoid	
omissions. Alcohol consumption was defined as consumption of alcohol at least once a week.	
Smoking was defined as currently smokes or ever smoked. Comorbidities included diabetes	
mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD),	
liver cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease, post-esophageal resection, and post-gastric resection. DM	
was considered present in patients taking anti-diabetes drugs. CKD was considered present in	
patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, or with serum creatinine levels 2.0 mg/dl.	
Patients were asked to indicate which drugs, if any, they had used based on drugs pictured in	
the questionnaire, as previously reported [17,18]. Use of a drug was defined as intermittent or

regular administration within 1 month before the questionnaire interview. Patients were asked	
about the following medication use: anticancer drugs for solid or hematological tumors; 5	
types of systemic corticosteroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone) and daily corticosteroid dose; 8 types of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); acetaminophen; 4 types of PPIs (lansoprazole, rabeprazole,	
omeprazole, and esomeprazole); and 6 types of H2RAs (nizatidine, roxatidine, famotidine,	
ranitidine, lafutidine, and cimetidine). We calculated prednisone-equivalent daily corticosteroid dose based on the data that glucocorticoid doses providing anti-inflammatory effects	
approximately equivalent to 5 mg prednisone are methylprednisolone 4 mg, betamethasone	
0.75 mg, dexamethasone 0.75mg, and hydrocortisone 20 mg [19].	
For HIV-infected patients, routes of infection were determined using questionnaires administered by medical staff [20] and classified into one of six categories: homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual, drug user, use of untreated blood products, or unknown. Sexual behavior was divided	
into two categories: men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual. Patients who were	
neither homosexual nor bisexual were regarded as heterosexual. CD4 cell count values obtained	
within 1 month before or after endoscopy were obtained from the medical records.	
Diagnosis of upper GI disease and candida esophagitis	
A high-resolution scope (GIF-H260, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was used for diagnosis of	
upper GI diseases. Well-trained staff performed endoscopy while blinded to the questionnaire	
results. When abnormal findings were detected on endoscopy, biopsy or endoscopic mucosal	
resection was performed. All removed specimens were evaluated by expert pathologists (>10	
years of experience), and final diagnoses of upper GI diseases were made. Diagnosis of CE was	
made on the basis that candida white plaques in the esophagus, detected by endoscopy, cannot	
be washed away [21] (Fig 1A and 1B) and confirmation by pathological assessment with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff staining (Fig 1C) or culture for Candida species	
[17,18].	
Statistical analysis	
In Study 1, we examined trends in CE prevalence over the 13-year study period in all subjects,	
HIV-infected patients, and non-HIV-infected patients, assessing changes in prevalence in	
2-year bins with the Chi-squared test for linear trends.	
In Study 2, we summarized descriptive data for patients with and without CE to identify	
risk factors. Patient characteristics were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative variables or the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for qualitative variables. The association between CE and other upper GI diseases was evaluated from both the endoscopy and	
pathology findings. CE risk factors were identified using a multiple logistic regression model	
including factors with a significance of P<0.2 on univariate analysis. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. CE risk factors were also evaluated separately for HIVinfected and non-HIV-infected patients.	
A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses	
were performed using Stata version13 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX).	
Results	
Study 1: Trends in CE Prevalence	
Between January 2002 and April 2014, 80,360 patients underwent upper endoscopy at NCGM.	
After exclusion, 80,219 patients were left for analysis. CE prevalence was 1.7% (1,375/80,219)

in all patients, 9.8% (156/1,595) in HIV-infected patients, 1.6% (1,219/78,624) in non-HIVinfected patients, and 1.8% (785/42,555) in patients aged >65 years. CE prevalence from 2002–	
2003 to 2012–2014 tended to increase in all subjects (0.8% to 2.7%, P<0.01 by trend test) (Fig	
2A) and in non-HIV-infected patients (0.6% to 2.5%, P<0.01 by trend test) (Fig 2B), but	
decrease in HIV-infected patients (13.6% to 9.0%, P = 0.097 by trend test) (Fig 2C).	
Study 2: Risk factors for CE	
Patient characteristics.	
Between September 2009 and April 2014, among the 32,827	
patients who underwent upper endoscopy, we did not conduct questionnaire interviews with	
23,485 patients because they either did not provide informed consent, did not know what medications they were receiving, were not independent in ADL, or could not understand written	
documents, and we found 3,331 patients met one of the exclusion criteria. This left a subcohort	
of 6,011 patients who underwent endoscopy and completed the questionnaire interview for	
analysis of CE risk.	
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The factors significantly associated with CE	
were alcohol consumption, HIV infection, CD4 cell count, history of HAART, HCV infection,	
syphilis, and use of corticosteroids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or PPIs. As shown in Table 2, the	
upper GI diseases significantly associated with CE were esophageal ulcer, gastric ulcer, and	
severe atrophic gastritis.	
Univariate and multivariate odds ratios for CE.	
Risk factors for CE identified by multivariate analysis are shown in Table 3. Increasing age, HIV infection, and corticosteroid use	
were independently associated with CE and smoker and acetaminophen were marginally associated with CE, but sex, alcohol consumption, HCV infection, syphilis, post-gastric resection,	
and use of NSAIDs or PPIs were not.

The risk factors identified by multivariate analysis for HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected	
patients are shown in Table 4. In HIV-infected patients, CD4 cell count<100μL significantly	
increased the risk of CE and history of HAART significantly decreased the risk. Among HIVinfected patients, 25% of the CE patients had CD4 cell counts >400/μL. In non-HIV-infected	
patients, increasing age and corticosteroid use were independently associated with CE, and	
HCV infection, peptic ulcer disease, and post-esophageal resection were marginally associated.	
Among corticosteroid users, higher prednisone-equivalent daily corticosteroid doses significantly increased the risk for CE (Table 5).	
Discussion	
In this study, we identified that, over the 13-year period from 2002 to 2014, CE prevalence	
showed significant increases in non-HIV-infected patients but decreases in HIV-infected	
patients. Moreover, risk analysis revealed that increasing age, HIV infection, and corticosteroids use were independently associated with CE, but alcohol, other infections, diabetes, anticancer drugs, and antisecretory drug use were not. Among HIV-infected patients, low CD4 cell	
count and absence of HAART were independent risk factors for CE. In corticosteroid users,	
higher prednisone-equivalent daily corticosteroid dose significantly increased CE risk.	
CE prevalence in non-HIV-infected patients is reported to 0.3–7.3% [5,8,10,22,23], which is	
consistent with our findings of 1.5% in non-HIV-infected patients. Similarly for HIV-infected

patients, CE prevalence was reported to be 42.8–51.8% in the pre-HAART era [24,25] and 8.5–	
16.7% in the HAART era [17,24], with which our finding of 9.8% prevalence in HIV-infected	
patients, most of whom received HAART (80.3%), concurs.	
Little information about CE trends has been available to date, and most studies have focused	
on HIV-infected patients [12,24]. Declining CE incidence has been reported in this patient population by Mocroft et al [12], from 5.7 person-years in 1994 to 0.5 person-years in 2004, and	
Nkuize et al [24], from 42.8% in 1991–1994, 23.5% in 1999–2002, and 16.7% in 2005–2008.	
Likewise, CE prevalence decreased from 13.6% in 2002–2003 to 9.0% in 2012–2014 in the present study. This is probably due to the introduction of HAART, which helped avoid immunodeficiency, and the development of effective prophylaxis against opportunistic infection [26]. In	
contrast, CE prevalence in non-HIV-infected patients showed a significant increase over the	
same period, likely because, in a rapidly aging society, more people have comorbidities and take	
immunosuppressants [27,28], which can lead to the development of CE.	
Several risk factors for CE have been investigated in case-control studies [6–8,10], although	
these studies had a small number of CE cases (three studies; n = 56 [6–8], one study; n = 163	
[10]) and retrospective in nature. They identified corticosteroid or PPIs use, heavy drinking,	
uncontrolled DM, and cancer as CE risk factors. In our larger scale study investigating the very	
same factors, multivariate analysis similarly identified systemic corticosteroid use but also	
revealed increasing age and HIV infection as risk factors for CE.

In terms of systemic corticosteroid use, an association was found in non-HIV-infected	
patients in this study. This could be explained by the suppression of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leucocytes by glucocorticoids, which can in turn lead to the development of CE	
[29]. Moreover, Heidenreich et al [30] showed that glucocorticoids principally affect the capacity of monocytes to control extracellular growth of Candida species by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion. We also found that higher prednisone-equivalent dose of	
corticosteroids was a risk factor for CE. Among the very few studies to date that have investigated the association between opportunistic infection and steroid dose, Yale et al [31] demonstrated that >30 mg of steroid daily was further associated with worsened Pneumocystis carinii	
pneumonia (PCP), compared with <30 mg daily, and Porges et al [32] demonstrated that >40	
mg daily was associated with PCP development among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Our study is the first to investigate the association between steroid dose and CE and our	
findings suggest that patients who receive high-dose steroids have lower cellular immunity,	
which can lead to CE development.	
Increasing age was identified as a risk factor for CE in non-HIV-infected patients in this	
study. It is possible that, in non-HIV-infected patients, increasing age leads to impaired immunity due to defects in the hematopoietic bone marrow and in peripheral lymphocyte migration,	
maturation, and function [9]. Another reason could be that increasing age causes a decline in	
cellular immunity of the epithelial layer, which can lead to colonization of Candida species [33].	
HIV infection itself was a risk factor for CE in this study. We suggest that impaired oral	
immunity plays a role in this. Oral immunity may be affected earlier than immunity in other	
organs [34] and thus facilitate the development of CE early in HIV infection. Indeed, Chih-Ko	
et al [34] demonstrated that salivary function is impaired early in the course of HIV infection.	
In the present study, the analysis of HIV-infected subjects showed an association between CD4	
cell count <100/μL and CE, although 25% of HIV-infected patients with CE also had a relatively high CD4 count (CD4>400). Buchacz et al found that the median CD4 cell count in CEinfected patients increased from 43/μL in the pre-HAART era (1994–1997) to 100/μL in the	
HAART era (2003–2007). These findings suggest that in the HAART era, HIV-infected	
patients are likely to develop CE even though their CD4 cell count is relatively high.

Previous studies have suggested that PPIs use is associated with CE because PPIs reduce gastric acidity, an important barrier for most microorganisms, and this can result in a number of	
infections [35]; however, the findings of this association are inconsistent. Chocarro et al [6]	
showed that, among 51 CE patients and 102 controls, PPIs use was independently associated	
with CE. In contrast, in case-control studies by Weerasuriya et al [7] and Choi et al [10], PPIs	
use was not associated with CE, consistent with our data. In clinical practice, PPIs are frequently administered when NSAIDs are used for protection from NSAID-induced peptic ulcer	
disease, but NSAID use was not adjusted for in previous studies that were also small in scale	
[6,7,10]. Therefore, a large-scale study with adjustment for NSAIDs is required to identify	
whether PPIs are a risk of CE.	
The strengths of this study include its prospective nature, large scale, and evaluation of	
detailed HIV information, which was obtained by performing HIV testing in all subjects. Its limitations include the following facts. 1) Because sufficient information was not collected on the	
pre-endoscopy setting, we could not evaluate the potential risk factors of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and antibiotic or herbal medication use. 2) Selection bias was present because	
endoscopy could not be performed for critically ill or intubated patients. 3) Endoscopy is not	
always performed for HIV-infected patients with oral candidiasis or esophageal symptoms who	
are empirically treated with antifungal therapy. Thus, this study potentially underestimated the	
number of CE cases. 4) This study has a cross-sectional design, so we can only comment on risk	
factors as being associated with disease but we cannot truly understand the causal pathways. 5)	
This case-control study is potentially affected by recall or interviewer bias, particularly for survey	
items on alcohol consumption, medication use, and smoking. Therefore, we attempted to limit	
bias by blinding survey results and performing surveys prior to endoscopy. 6) The community	
setting of the controls (undergoing endoscopy without CE) may have been different from that of	
cases (patients with CE); thus, unmeasured confounders exist. In particular, co-morbidities have	
a confounding effect. In addition, the study would have been better if subjects had been matched	
for age, sex, and co-morbidities rather than just adjusting the model for these factors.	
In conclusion, this study identified that CE prevalence over a 13-year period increased in	
non-HIV-infected patients but decreased in HIV-infected patients. Besides increasing age,	
HIV infection itself and corticosteroid use increased the risk for CE development, but antisecretory drug use did not. In HIV-infected patients, a low CD4 count and absence of HAART	
were independent risk factors for CE. In corticosteroid users, CE was associated with higher	
prednisone-equivalent dose. Given that the elderly tend to have co-morbidities and take drugs,	
CE prevalence is expected to continue increasing in today’s rapid aging society.

Instrumental lesions, spontaneous rupture, and trauma	
cause most esophageal perforations. Transmural fungal	
infection is extremely rare, although Candida may be	
detected in as many as 25% of normal esophagus. In this	
report we present a case of fatal esophageal perforation	
due to transmural Candida infection in a 76-year-old	
woman. The patient died from septic shock and multiorgan failure, despite esophageal resection and systemic	
antifungal therapy. Pathogenetic aspects and treatment	
strategies are discussed.

sophageal perforation is an uncommon clinical entity, which is associated with increased morbidity	
and mortality rates [1]. Among different reasons that may	
lead to esophageal perforation, transmural Candida infection of the esophageus is extremely rare. We could only	
identify four cases in current English literature.	
Particularly characterized by its ability to survive in	
distinct anatomical sites, Candida albicans mucositis of the	
gastrointestinal and urogenital tract is further facilitated	
by changes of a host immunity (eg, depletion of CD4	
leukocytes in patients with AIDS) [2]. Immunosuppression regimen after organ transplantation and prolonged	
stay in intensive care units due to major surgery particularly promote Candida infection of the esophagointestinal mucosa [3].	
We report a case of fatal esophageal perforation as a	
sequel of transmural esophageal Candida infection in a	
woman with a symptomatic paraesophageal hernia.	
A 76-year-old woman had been treated as in-hospital	
patient for actinic skin lesions that occurred after radiation therapy for vaginal carcinoma, when she had acute	
left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath develop.	
Coronary heart disease, mild impairment of renal function, and ileocecal resection for small bowel carcinoma	
were preexisting comorbidities.	
Chest roentgenogram revealed left pleural effusion	
and pulmonary inﬁltration, as well as an enlarged mediastinum. Cardiac ischemia was suspected because of	
electrocardiographic changes, whereas laboratory ﬁndings were all within normal ranges, particularly troponin	
and D-dimer. Empirical antibiotic treatment was started	
without further investigations, and the patient slightly	
improved during the following 2 days. Then the patient	
became rapidly septic with cardiopulmonary disturbances, increasing pain, and C-reactive protein (CRP)	
levels. Computed tomographic scan of the thorax demonstrated a seropneumothorax and extensive left-sided	
pulmonary atelectasis formation. In addition, multiple	
mediastinal air bubbles and a large paraesophageal hernia were detected (Fig 1).	
The patient underwent emergency surgical exploration	
by a median upper laparotomy. Intraoperatively, a 4-cm	
longitudinal opening of the distal esophagus was detected that had induced extensive necrosis formation in	
the posterior mediastinum. Due to the advanced inﬂammatory changes, esophageal resection and mediastinal	
drainage were performed through an additional right	
anterior thoracotomy. A right-sided descending aorta	
further complicated the operation. Restoration of gastrointestinal continuity was achieved by creating a gastric	
tube vascularized by the right gastroepiploic artery that	
was connected with the proximal esophagus in the upper	
mediastinum. The postoperative course was severely	
protracted by the ongoing sepsis and development of a	
multiorgan failure. The patient never recovered and died	
on postoperative day 17.	
Histologic examination of the specimen revealed transmural ulceration at the esophagogastric junction with	
concomitant severe mediastinitis. Within that ulceration,	
large masses of fungal hyphal elements were found (Fig	
2). Additional microbiological analysis identiﬁed C. albicans and Candida norvegensis. These Candida species were	
also detected in the sputum, vagina, and pleural cavities.	
Comment	
Candida represents a commensal fungus of different mucous membranes in healthy individuals. The esophagus	
is colonized in as much as 25% of normal individuals [4].	
However, invasive infections causing extensive tissue	
necrosis and ulceration predominantly occur in immunocompromised patients after major surgical procedures	
or prolonged intensive care unit stays, and also in patients with organ transplantations [3]. It has only been	
partially elucidated which factors may contribute to promote progression from simple colonization to invasive	
disease [5]. Competent T-cell immune response is a	
crucial protecting mechanism against cutaneous, vaginal,	
and oral Candidiasis in patients with AIDS who are	
known to develop oral Candidiasis in as much as 70% [6].	
Resistance to systemic fungal infection is closely associated with normal mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophil response [5]. Moreover, it has been hypothesized	
that depending on speciﬁc preexisting host deﬁciencies,	
different forms of Candidiasis may occur. The invasiveAccepted for publication Feb 20, 2004.

ness of different Candida strains induces various types of	
diseases and host responses accordingly [2, 5].	
Transmural invasive Candida infection remains an extremely rare cause of esophagointestinal perforation. By	
thoroughly reviewing the current English literature, we	
could only ﬁnd 4 patients with esophageal perforation	
that were histologically conﬁrmed to be caused by transmural Candida infection [7, 8]. Jones and colleagues [8]	
reported severe necrotizing Candida esophagitis in 2	
insulin-dependent diabetic patients after renal transplantation. The ﬁrst patient was a 34-year-old woman	
who died 6 months after transplantation. She had ulcerative Candida esophagitis develop 2 weeks postoperatively. Despite amphotericin B treatment she had an	
esophagomediastinal ﬁstula develop, and she died after	
sudden massive hematemesis. Autopsy disclosed a ruptured mycotic aneurysmal of a peripheral pulmonary	
artery. The second patient was a 40-year-old human who	
had characteristic Candida esophagitis develop 35 days	
after transplantation. An esophagram taken 66 days after	
the operation showed a ﬁstula between the esophagus	
and the main stem of the left bronchus. Despite treatment with amphotericin B, decompressive gastrostomy,	
esophagostomy above the ﬁstula, and dissection below	
the ﬁstula, the patient became septic and died 3 months	
after transplantation. An autopsy showed a septal myocardial infarction as the cause of death [8]. Both patients	
developed invasive Candida esophagitis in the early posttransplant course. Despite prophylactic oral nystatin	
treatment, esophageal perforation could not be	
prevented.	
Another two cases of nonfatal esophageal perforation	
related to invasive Candidiasis were reported by Gaissert	
and colleagues [7]. The ﬁrst patient (a 10-year-old boy	
with Down syndrome) underwent chemotherapy for	
acute B-cell lymphocytic leukemia when he had esophageal necrosis develop. The second patient (a 27-year-old	
autistic human) underwent diagnostic esophagogastroscopy for esophageal Candidiasis. Delayed perforation of	
the esophageal wall occurred 3 months later at the biopsy	
location. Emergency esophagectomy and cervical	
esophagostomy were performed. Moreover, systemic antifungal therapy was started. Both patients survived and	
revealed a good long-term outcome after restoration of	
gastrointestinal continuity by using a gastric conduit.	
In our patient, a preexisting esophageal colonization	
with Candida can be assumed. Temporary incarceration	
of the paraesophageal hernia probably caused a mucosal	
damage at the gastroesophageal junction. Transmural	
ulceration by invasive Candidiasis was therefore facilitated by the impaired mucosal defense. At the time of	
delayed diagnosis, esophageal perforation was advanced	
and extensive mediastinitis was already established.	
Successful treatment of invasive Candida infection	
complicated by esophageal perforation requires both	
long-term systemic antifungal therapy and emergency	
surgical intervention. Surgery must include esophageal	
resection, extensive necrosectomy, and drainage of the	
pleural cavities and mediastinum. Correction of the patient’s immunosuppressive drugs should be attempted.	
Because there are only a very few cases that have been	
reported so far, no established treatment regimen has	
been validated and long-term outcome probably remains	
poor.	
In conclusion, esophageal perforation due to invasive	
Candidiasis is an extremely rare complication, although	
its true incidence may be underestimated. Despite aggressive medical and surgical treatment, the patient’s	
prognosis remains poor.	

A more plausible explanation for this early and rapid	
cardiac failure is related to the low cardiac output syndrome, which is seen in up to 28% of patients with	
chronic constrictive pericarditis after undergoing pericardiectomy [9, 10]. It is believed that the postoperative	
myocardial dysfunction in this setting is related to myocardial atrophy. The chronic external support of the heart	
by the tight pericardium and ﬂuid when released may	
allow the heart to overdilate rapidly, leading to systolic dysfunction and heart failure. If this pathophysiologic mechanism also occurs in some patients with	
acute tamponade, then the suggestion by Neelakandan	
and associates [6] for gradual decompression of the	
pericardial effusion may have some merit, although the	
practical implementation of this suggestion may be difﬁcult. Presumably pericardiocentesis with gradual removal of pericardial ﬂuid with an indwelling catheter	
might be a feasible approach. However, this syndrome,	
no matter how lethal, is relatively rare and recommendations on prevention will await characterization of the	
patients at risk. Therefore, at present until more information is available, we recommend only that anesthesiologists, cardiologists, and thoracic surgeons be aware of	
the possibility that their patient might develop transient	
or even fatal heart failure after relief of a benign or	
malignant pericardial tamponade, similar to that seen in	
our patient. Treatment for this problem should be supportive with appropriate invasive monitoring and inotropic support, which will result in recovery in some	
patients.
